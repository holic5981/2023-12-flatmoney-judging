# Users may not be able to adjust their leverage if there is not enough collateral in the vault

## Summary

For leverage adjust execution, the keeper fee is sent to the vault after paying the keeper. This means that if there is not enough collateral available in the vault, the transaction will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the leverage adjust execution, when `marginAdjustment` is positive, the chain of events is as follows:

- In the `DelayedOrder` contract there is a [call to `LeverageModule.executeAdjust`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L598-L602).
- The keeper fee is [sent to the keeper](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LeverageModule.sol#L235) from the vault.
- The collateral, including the keeper fee, is [sent from `DelayedOrder` to the vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L606-L609
).

As we can see, the keeper fee is sent from the vault to the keeper before it is sent from the `DelayedOrder` contract to the vault. This means that if there is not enough collateral available in the vault, the transaction will fail.

## Impact

Users may not be able to adjust their leverage if there is not enough collateral in the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Transfer the collateral from the `DelayedOrder` contract to the vault before calling `LeverageModule` as it is done [in `_executeLeverageOpen` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L572-L581).
