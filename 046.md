# user/MEV can frontrun and backrun the oracle update of an rETH price  and steal funds from the protocol(Possible arbitrage from oracle price discrepancy )

## Summary
The problem is that a user can know which direction the oracle price of a rETH  will move, before it does, either through watching the rETH price  move in advance of the oracle updating, or watching the mempool for oracle update transactions and frontrunning them.


## Vulnerability Detail
Letâ€™s take example , let assume
1e18 rETHl price = 1e18 , now the exchange rate of the asset will be updated to 1e18 rETH price = 0.95e18..
user/MEV can frontrun and let assume users  mint 100 UNIT (as oracle price is still not updated yet) . After the oracle price is updated, the user can backrun(withdraw his 100 UNIT) because 100 UNIT is now worth 105 rETH. So user/mev make a profit of 5 rETH.

This can also happen in opposite direction,let assume
1 rETH price = 1 , now the exchange rate of the asset will be updated to 1 rETH price = 1.05 .user/MEV(previously deposited) can frontrun and withdraw 100 UNIT (as oracle price is still not updated yet).After the oracle price is updated, the user can backrun and deposit 100 rETH, and get 105 UNIT .

## Impact
Attackers can gain profit and steal collateral .

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implementing a 1 hour waiting period on deposit/ withdraw or
storing minting and redemptions and executing them at a future exchange rate or creating pause/unpause for minting/redeeming .
