# Lack of input validation announceStableDeposit function

## Summary
In the `announceStableDeposit` function, the `depositAmount` is the amount of collateral to deposit. However, there is no check to ensure that the `depositAmount` is greater than zero. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called with a `depositAmount` of zero or less. 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function announceStableDeposit(
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint256 keeperFee
) external whenNotPaused {
    uint64 executableAtTime = _prepareAnnouncementOrder(keeperFee);
    vault.checkCollateralCap(depositAmount);
    if (depositAmount < MIN_DEPOSIT)
        revert FlatcoinErrors.AmountTooSmall({amount: depositAmount, minAmount: MIN_DEPOSIT});
    // Check that the requested minAmountOut is feasible
    uint256 quotedAmount = IStableModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._STABLE_MODULE_KEY))
        .stableDepositQuote(depositAmount);
    if (quotedAmount < minAmountOut)
        revert FlatcoinErrors.HighSlippage(quotedAmount, minAmountOut);
    _announcedOrder[msg.sender] = FlatcoinStructs.Order({
        orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.StableDeposit,
        orderData: abi.encode(
            FlatcoinStructs.AnnouncedStableDeposit({depositAmount: depositAmount, minAmountOut: minAmountOut})
        ),
        keeperFee: keeperFee,
        executableAtTime: executableAtTime
    });
    // Sends collateral to the delayed order contract first before it is settled by keepers and sent to the vault
    vault.collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount + keeperFee);
    emit FlatcoinEvents.OrderAnnounced({
        account: msg.sender,
        orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.StableDeposit,
        keeperFee: keeperFee
    });
}
```

## Impact

In the above code, the `depositAmount` is used directly without any validation. If a user were to call this function with a `depositAmount` of zero, the function would still execute, potentially leading to unexpected results. 

For example, the `depositAmount` is used to transfer collateral from the user to the contract. If the `depositAmount` is zero, no collateral would be transferred, but the function would still execute and the order would still be announced. This could lead to a situation where an order is announced but no collateral is actually deposited, which could cause issues when the order is executed.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
To prevent this, the function should include a check to ensure that the `depositAmount` is greater than zero before proceeding. This could be done with a simple `require` statement at the beginning of the function:

```solidity
require(depositAmount > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero");
```

This would cause the function to revert if the `depositAmount` is not greater than zero, preventing the rest of the function from executing and avoiding the potential issues described above
