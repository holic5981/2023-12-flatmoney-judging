# Mint Points Reverts When Locked Amount Less Than Mint Amount

## Summary

Minting points process is disrupted when a user has fewer points than the amount intended to mint.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is an underflow issue when `mintAmount` exceeds `lockedAmount`. This situation occurs when a user attempts to mint more tokens than currently locked, leading to a revert.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/PointsModule.sol#L142-L155
```solidity
    function _setMintUnlockTime(address account, uint256 mintAmount) internal returns (uint256 newUnlockTime) {
        uint256 lockedAmount = _lockedAmount[account];
        uint256 unlockTimeBefore = unlockTime[account];

        if (unlockTimeBefore <= block.timestamp) {
            newUnlockTime = block.timestamp + unlockTaxVest;
        } else {
            uint256 newUnlockTimeAmount = (block.timestamp + unlockTaxVest) * mintAmount;
            uint256 oldUnlockTimeAmount = unlockTimeBefore * (lockedAmount - mintAmount); // <----------------
            newUnlockTime = (newUnlockTimeAmount + oldUnlockTimeAmount) / lockedAmount;
        }

        unlockTime[account] = newUnlockTime;
    }
```

Complicating the issue, the `PointsModule._setMintUnlockTime` function is indirectly called during critical operations like executing a pending order via `DelayedOrder.executeOrder()` and opening leverage with `LeverageModule.executeOpen()`. 

## Impact

This is a medium-severity issue because it disrupts core functionalities such as deposit execution and leverage opening due to the minting points function reverting when a user's existing points are fewer than the mint amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check to ensure the user's locked points are greater than or equal to the mint amount:
