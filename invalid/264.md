# When skewFractionMax is lowered, liquidity providers will not be able to withdraw.

## Summary

When `skewFractionMax` is being lowered by admin, certain liquidity providers will have their tokens locked, without a way to be withdrawn.

For example, when `skewFractionMax` is lowered from 120% to 100%, **only the users who have enough amount of collateral tokens to bring the skew fraction below the max will be able to unblock the withdrawals.**

## Vulnerability Detail

The skew factor is checked either when liquidity provider withdraws or trader opens a leveraged position. 

It is used to prevent the system from being skewed towards the longs as we can see:

```solidity
/// @notice Asserts that the system will not be too skewed towards longs after additional skew is added (position change).
    /// @param _additionalSkew The additional skew added by either opening a long or closing an LP position.
    function checkSkewMax(uint256 _additionalSkew) public view {
        // check that skew is not essentially disabled
        if (skewFractionMax < type(uint256).max) {
            uint256 sizeOpenedTotal = _globalPositions.sizeOpenedTotal;

            if (stableCollateralTotal == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("stableCollateralTotal");

            uint256 longSkewFraction = ((sizeOpenedTotal + _additionalSkew) * 1e18) / stableCollateralTotal;

            if (longSkewFraction > skewFractionMax) revert FlatcoinErrors.MaxSkewReached(longSkewFraction);
        }
    } 
```

In simpler words when skew factor is set to 120% (taken from the deployment config) maximum leveraged long positions with a total size of **120e18** can be opened for every **100e18** of deposited stable collateral tokens (UNIT).

This can be problematic, **especially when `skewFraction` is being lowered.**

Current `skewFraction` = 120% in bullish scenarios, then `skewFraction` is being lowered to 100%, the remaining 20% UNIT LP tokens are locked in the system and there is no way to be withdrawn unless UNIT LP holder, having enough tokens to bring it to 100% deposits or big leveraged positions are closed, but the second scenario is assumed to not happen given the increasing price of the rETH and leveraged traders profiting.

Additionally, leveraged positions will be bricked too because every single wei increasing the `skewFraction` will revert.

## Impact

Liquidity providers will be locked inside the protocol without way to withdraw their funds, unless there are other depositors willing to decrease the `skewFraction`, but then their funds will be locked, because of the other LPs withdrawing and bringing the fraction back to the max value.

Leveraged trading positions will be DoS because the skew will be at the upper limit, without way to be lowered unless someone intentionally lock his funds by depositing in the LP vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As this is a tricky situation to handle we are proposing to checking the current `skewFraction` when updating it in the setter function:

```solidity
/// @notice Setter for the maximum leverage total skew fraction.
    /// @dev This ensures that stable LPs are not too short by capping long trader total open interest.
    ///      Note that `_skewFractionMax` should include 18 decimals.
    /// @param _skewFractionMax The maximum limit of total leverage long size vs stable LP.
    function setSkewFractionMax(uint256 _skewFractionMax) public onlyOwner {
        if (_skewFractionMax < 1e18) revert FlatcoinErrors.InvalidSkewFractionMax(_skewFractionMax);

        skewFractionMax = _skewFractionMax;
    }
```

That way the whole situation will be prevented and no funds will be locked, but it opens another griefing opportunity for the UNIT LP holders to deny the lowering of the `skewFraction`, because the overall amount of fees that they receive will be lowered also.
