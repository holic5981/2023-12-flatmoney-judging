# Redundant validation maxAge < type(uint32).max in OracleModule:_getprice

## Summary
The function _getPrice incurs unnecessary gas consumption due to a redundant check ensuring that the max age is not above type(uint32).max. This inefficiency is amplified as the function is repeatedly called by multiple modules throughout the protocol's operation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The redundancy of this check arises from the fact that the Solidity compiler inherently includes a verification mechanism, preventing compilation if the value of maxAge exceeds type(uint32).max.

## Impact
Frequent gas loss occurs every time the function is called throughout the protocol's lifetime, as it redundantly performs a manual check for maxAge < type(uint32).max, even though the compiler has already conducted this validation.

## Recommendation
remove the maxAge < type(uint32).max check from the `if` statement
