# `_getOnchainPrice` will return a price with 28 decimals rather than 18

## Summary
`_getOnchainPrice` will return a price with 28 decimals rather than 18.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_getOnchainPrice` expects that the value returned by Chainlink oracle will have 8 decimals and hence multiplies the value with 10^10 to have 18 decimals. But, this is not always the case. Chainlink oracles also return prices with 18 decimals. This is the case with the reth oracle on base. It has 18 decimals and hence the multiplication with 10^10 will give out a price of 28 decimals which is incorrect. Check the oracle here - https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=reth

## Impact
The wrong price value is used by the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Multiply the price value with the correct number of decimals to get price in terms of 18 decimals.
