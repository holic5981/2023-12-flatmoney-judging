# Potential misuse of `assert` statement

## Summary
Potential misuse of assert statement

## Vulnerability Detail
The `assert` statement is used for internal consistency checks. Primarily, it is used during development and testing stages to catch and identify bugs but they are removed in production builds of the contract. This means that they only run during testing and not in the live contract. To enforce this check in production, `require` should be used instead of `assert`.

## Impact
It could lead to unexpected behavior in the live contract if the condition checked by the `assert` statement fails. Since `assert` statements are removed in production builds, this could lead to silent failures that may be difficult to debug.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/libraries/PerpMath.sol#L26-L37
 ```solidity
function _proportionalSkew(int256 skew, uint256 stableCollateralTotal) internal pure returns (int256 pSkew) {
        if (stableCollateralTotal > 0) {
            pSkew = skew._divideDecimal(int256(stableCollateralTotal));

            if (pSkew < -1e18 || pSkew > 1e18) {
                pSkew = DecimalMath.UNIT.min(pSkew.max(-DecimalMath.UNIT));
            }
        } else {
            assert(skew == 0);
            pSkew = 0;
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the `assert` statement with a `require` statement to ensure the check is enforced even in production builds.
