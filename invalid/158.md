# Insufficient checks for Unlocked tokens and Denial of Service Attack

## Summary
The ERC20LockableUpgradeable.sol contract has 2 issues within its `_beforeTokenTransfer` function which compromises the functionality and security of token transfers. I'll try to go straight to the point.

## Vulnerability Detail
**1.) Unconsidered Locked Amount:**
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function lacks consideration for the locked amount when checking if the sender has enough unlocked tokens. In the event an attacker locks all tokens of an account, the account is effectively denied the ability to send any tokens. 

**2.) Insufficient Check for Unlocked Tokens:**
The `_beforeTokenTransfer` function has a flawed check for unlocked tokens, relying solely on the balance minus the locked amount. If the locked amount equals the balance, the condition `balanceOf(from) - _lockedAmount[from] >= amount` will always evaluate to false for any non-zero transfer amount which could possibly prevent legitimate transfers.
## Impact

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/misc/ERC20LockableUpgradeable.sol#L45-L59

```solidity
 
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
        // Make sure the sender has enough unlocked tokens.
        // Note: the below requirement is not needed when minting tokens in which case the `from` address is 0x0.
        if (from != address(0)) {
            require(
                balanceOf(from) - _lockedAmount[from] >= amount,
                "ERC20LockableUpgradeable: insufficient unlocked balance"
            );
        }

        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }

    uint256[49] private __gap;
}
```



## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
For the first issue, The `_lock` and `_unlock` functions should have access control to prevent unauthorized access. This could involve using the `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized` modifiers to restrict who can call these functions. Alternatively, users could be allowed to reclaim their locked tokens under certain conditions, such as after a certain period of time.

For the second issue, I'd suggest the balance check logic within `_beforeTokenTransfer` should consider both the balance and locked amount, ensuring transfers are allowed even when the locked amount equals the balance.
