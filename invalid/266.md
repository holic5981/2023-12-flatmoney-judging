# UNIT LP holders can sandwich leverage traders closing their positions and avoid price impact.

## Summary

Liquidity providers can avoid price impact by sandwiching both announce and execute functions from leverage traders to close their positions. 

They can write script which does everything for them and avoid the price impact to be bear by the other users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem is that a large liquidity provider can build a script to front run and then backrun `announceLeverageClose()`, and also execute the trader close request as keeper. 

1. Front run `announceLeverageClose()` with `announceStableWithdraw()`
2. Back run `announceLeverageClose()` with `_executeStableWithdraw()`
3. Execute `_executeLeverageClose()` as a keeper
4. Then deposit again

## Impact

LP can avoid paying the trader when he is on profit.

## Recommendation

It's hard to give a proper recommendation, maybe lock LPs tokens when there will be a long position close.
