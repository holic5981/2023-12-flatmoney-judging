# Missing slippage protection in the liquidation

## Summary

Missing slippage protection during the liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `liquidate` function in `LiquadionModule.sol` calculates the amount of funds that will be liquidated. This computation relies on asset prices retrieved from an oracle through the `IOracleModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._ORACLE_MODULE_KEY)).getPrice()` call. However, it's important to highlight the absence of slippage protection in this process.

## Impact

There's no guarantee that the amount returned by the `liquidate` function corresponds to the current market price. This is because the transaction that updates the price feed might be mined before the actual call to batchLiquidateBorrow. As a result, users may experience liquidation amounts that differ from their expectations.

Consider a scenario where a user initiates a `liquidate` function. Due to an oracle malfunction or significant price fluctuations, the amount of collateral transferred from the module might be much lower than the user would have anticipated based on the current market conditions.

It is recommended to introduce a parameter that would empower the caller to set a threshold for the minimum acceptable value for the liquidation. By doing so, users can explicitly state their assumptions about the liquidation and ensure that the collateral payout remains as profitable as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add e.g. minimumLiquidatedValue parameter and add a check verifying that the
reward value is greater than or equal to the minimumLiquidatedValue value.
