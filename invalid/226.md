# refund mechanism

## Summary
The refund mechanism in updatePythPrice uses a direct call to send ETH, which is a potential security risk. It should ensure that the call's gas limit is set to prevent reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
 if (msg.value - fee > 0) {
            // Need to refund caller. Try to return unused value, or revert if failed
            (bool success, ) = sender.call{value: msg.value - fee}("");
            if (success == false) revert FlatcoinErrors.RefundFailed();
## Impact
 It should ensure that the call's gas limit is set to prevent reentrancy attacks.
