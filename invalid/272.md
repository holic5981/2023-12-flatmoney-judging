# Front-Running Attacks in settleFundingFees and updateGlobalPositionData functions

## Summary
The `settleFundingFees` and `updateGlobalPositionData` functions are vulnerable to front-running attacks. These functions use the current price of the underlying asset, which can be manipulated by front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `settleFundingFees` function settles the funding fees between longs and LPs. If an attacker can front-run this transaction, they could potentially manipulate the funding fees to their advantage.

Similarly, the `updateGlobalPositionData` function updates the global position data based on the current price of the underlying asset. A front-runner could potentially manipulate the price used in this function by executing a transaction that changes the price before this function is executed.

## Impact
Front-running transactions
