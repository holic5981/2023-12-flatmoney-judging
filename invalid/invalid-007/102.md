# Traders may lose funds because of pause.

## Summary
Traders may lose funds because of system paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
I believe whenNotPaused is used in some emergency cases. However, traders cannot close their leverage position when executeClose() is paused, which could cause traders lose funds.
