# Lack of validation of `priceLowerThreshold` and `priceUpperThreshold` value

## Summary
Lack of TP/SL value check against current price may leads user cost unintended loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
`priceLowerThreshold` and `priceUpperThreshold` in `announceLimitOrder()` allows trader to set TP/SL. But it lacks the price validation against current price. It fails to verify whether the TP price is greater than the current market price and whether the SL price is less than the current market price. Consequently, traders may unknowingly set TP and SL prices that cause them to close position in lesser profit or loss only because protocol does not have simple check. 

Additionally, the comment provided by the developer, indicating that the function is currently only used for closing existing orders. So, there are chances that function can also be used to set TP/SL when opening the positions.
```solidity
/// @dev Currently can only be used for closing existing orders
```
It is noted that it is completely trader's mistakes. But no trader would do this intentionally. It always happens by mystically. 

## Impact
Position could be close in lesser profit than expected or in loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
(uint256 price, ) = IOracleModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._ORACLE_MODULE_KEY)).getPrice();
if (price <= priceLowerThreshold) revert();
else if(price >= priceUpperThreshold) revert();
```
