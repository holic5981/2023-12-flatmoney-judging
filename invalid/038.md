# Flawed Token Transfer Logic

## Summary
The **DelayedOrder** contract exhibits critical vulnerabilities in its token transfer logic, particularly in functions handling user deposits and withdrawals. This flaw could lead to unauthorized token transfers or balance manipulation.
## Vulnerability Detail
A key function, such as **announceStableWithdraw**, handles token transfers without adequately checking the user's balance before executing the transfer. This oversight can result in transferring more tokens than the user holds, potentially leading to negative balances.
```solidity
function announceStableWithdraw(
    uint256 withdrawAmount,
    // ... other parameters
) external whenNotPaused {
    // ...
    // Issue: No check to ensure 'withdrawAmount' is <= user's balance
    _**vault.collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), withdrawAmount);**_
    // ...
}
```
In this snippet, the contract transfers tokens without confirming if **withdrawAmount** is within the user's available balance.
## Impact
**User Balance Overdrawn:**

- A user with a balance of 100 tokens requests a withdrawal of 150 tokens.
- The contract processes this withdrawal without validation.
- This results in an overdrawn balance, creating inconsistencies in the contract's token management and ledger.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Balance Check Implementation:**
Add balance checks before executing token transfers to ensure the requested amount does not exceed the user's available balance.
**Proposed Code Fix:**
```solidity
function announceStableWithdraw(
    uint256 withdrawAmount,
    // ... other parameters
) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 userBalance = vault.collateral().balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(withdrawAmount <= userBalance, "Withdrawal exceeds balance");
    vault.collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), withdrawAmount);
    // ...
}
```
This fix will prevent the contract from processing withdrawals that exceed a user's balance, thus maintaining the integrity of the token ledger and safeguarding user funds.
