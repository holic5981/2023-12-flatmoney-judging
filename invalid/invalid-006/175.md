# liquidation process should not be paused while the protocol is paused

## Summary
We see the `liquidate` function is protected by `whenNotPaused`, when the LiquidationModule is paused then the keeper/liquidator bots are unable to liquidate the liquidated positions which causes major losses for the LPs and the protocol.
There should be a list of whilte-listed keeper/liquidator bots they are able to liquidate positions even if the protocol is paused.
## Vulnerability Detail
`liquidate` function is protected by `whenNotPaused`:
```solidity
function liquidate(uint256 tokenId) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused liquidationInvariantChecks(vault, tokenId) {
```
Now assume many long positions are liquidated due to a drop in price of rETH and LiquidationModule is paused.
We assume the totalPnL of those positions are now 0$, if the price drops more and more, then the totalPnL will go into negative if they not being liquidated immediately, then the LPs will lose more and more collaterals/funds/rETH's.

When the protocol is paused then no keeper/liquidator bots can call `liquidate` to liquidate those positions, then if the price drops more, those liquidated positions will make a huge loss for the LPs (UNIT holders, Short positions) and the protocol.
There should be at least a list of whitelisted keeper/liquidator bots which are able to liquidate the positions even if the Module is paused.
## Impact
If the LiquidationModule is paused, then no one can call `liquidate` to liquidate the liquidated-positions and then if the price drops more, the liquidated positions will make more and more losses for LPs and the Protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a list of white-listed keeper/liquidator bots, they are allowed to liquidate the liquidated-positions even if the protocol is paused.
