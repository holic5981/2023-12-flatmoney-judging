# Users that create a limit order can get their long positions closed with a price less than the stop-loss price they specified.

## Summary
The ``FlatMoney`` protocol allows users to create limit orders where they can specify a stop-loss price as well as profit-take price by calling the [``announceLimitOrder()``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L58-L83)  function. The problem arises in the [_closePosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L151-L153) function 
```solidity
if (price <= _limitOrder.priceLowerThreshold) {
            minFillPrice = 0; // can execute below lower limit price threshold
}
```
If the current price is below the ``priceLowerThreshold`` specified by the user when he was creating the limit order the new ``minFillPrice`` will be set to 0. When [``executeClose()``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LeverageModule.sol#L255C14-L317) function is then called we have the following check 
```solidity
(uint256 exitPrice, ) = IOracleModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._ORACLE_MODULE_KEY)).getPrice({
            maxAge: maxAge
        });
        if (exitPrice < announcedClose.minFillPrice)
            revert FlatcoinErrors.HighSlippage(exitPrice, announcedClose.minFillPrice);
```
The above check will always go trough as the ``exitPrice`` can't be less than 0 (the function call will revert otherwise), which means that the limit order can be closed with a price that is below the ``priceLowerThreshold`` specified by the user. Thus the user will receive less rETH tokens back.
The ``executeLimitOrder()`` can be called by anyone, once the min amount of time has passed.

Summary

## Impact
User's long positions can be closed with a price less than the stop-loss price they specified when they created a limit order.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider rewriting this 
```solidity
if (price <= _limitOrder.priceLowerThreshold) {
            minFillPrice = 0; // can execute below lower limit price threshold
        }
``` 
so it adheres to the lowerThreshold the user has specified when creating the limit order
