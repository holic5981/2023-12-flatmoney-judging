# Inadequate Keeper Fee and Slippage Validation

## Summary
The **DelayedOrder** contract's management of keeper fees and control of minimum slippage in order announcement functions could lead to financial inefficiencies and potential losses.
## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose a user announces a stable deposit with **depositAmount = 1,000** tokens, a **minAmountOut = 900** tokens, and a **keeperFee = 100** tokens. The contract directly transfers **depositAmount + keeperFee = 1,100** tokens without validating if the keeper fee is excessive or misaligned with market conditions. Additionally, if the **quotedAmount** received for the **depositAmount** is significantly less than **minAmountOut** (e.g., only 850 tokens due to market volatility), the user might still proceed with the transaction, facing an undesired high slippage.

```solidity
function announceStableDeposit(
    uint256 depositAmount,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint256 keeperFee
) external whenNotPaused {
    // ...
    vault.collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmount + keeperFee);
    // ...
}
```

## Impact
This issue could result in users paying excessive fees for keeper services or facing high slippage without adequate warning, leading to financial losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**1. Dynamic Keeper Fee Calculation:**
Implement a method to calculate keeper fees dynamically, ensuring they align with transaction complexity and market conditions.

**2. Enhanced Slippage Checks:**
Introduce stricter checks on the minAmountOut parameter to safeguard against high slippage scenarios.

// Dynamic Fee Calculation
function calculateDynamicKeeperFee(uint256 transactionAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // Logic for calculating dynamic fees
}

```solidity
// Enhanced Slippage Checks
function validateSlippage(uint256 quotedAmount, uint256 minAmountOut) internal pure {
    require(quotedAmount >= minAmountOut, "Slippage exceeds tolerance");
}

// Implementing in announce functions
function announceStableDeposit(uint256 depositAmount, uint256 minAmountOut, uint256 keeperFee) external whenNotPaused {
    uint256 calculatedFee = calculateDynamicKeeperFee(depositAmount);
    require(keeperFee >= calculatedFee && keeperFee <= maxFeeLimit, "Invalid keeper fee");
    validateSlippage(quotedAmount, minAmountOut);
    // Continue with the rest of the function...
}
```
