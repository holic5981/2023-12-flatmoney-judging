# Users can not increase or decrease margin while ````screw >= 120````

## Summary
In current implementation, the max allowed screw is ````120%````, increasing new position size would be rejected above this threshold. But actually, pure increasing or decreasing collateral would be reverted too. As this two operations are not related to net position changes, so they should be allowed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arise on L163 of ````LeverageModule.sol````, the ````= 0 ```` case which represent increasing or decreasing collateral  would be rejected while current screw is bigger than ````120%```` (L166 & L305).
```solidity
File: src/LeverageModule.sol
163:         if (announcedAdjust.additionalSizeAdjustment >= 0) { // @audit the 0 case ?
164:             // Given that the size of a position is being increased, it's necessary to check that
165:             // it doesn't exceed the max skew limit.
166:             vault.checkSkewMax(uint256(announcedAdjust.additionalSizeAdjustment));
167: 
168:             if (adjustPrice > announcedAdjust.fillPrice)
169:                 revert FlatcoinErrors.HighSlippage(adjustPrice, announcedAdjust.fillPrice);
170:         } else {
171:             if (adjustPrice < announcedAdjust.fillPrice)
172:                 revert FlatcoinErrors.HighSlippage(adjustPrice, announcedAdjust.fillPrice);
173:         }

File: src/FlatcoinVault.sol
296:     function checkSkewMax(uint256 _additionalSkew) public view {
297:         // check that skew is not essentially disabled
298:         if (skewFractionMax < type(uint256).max) {
299:             uint256 sizeOpenedTotal = _globalPositions.sizeOpenedTotal;
300: 
301:             if (stableCollateralTotal == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("stableCollateralTotal");
302: 
303:             uint256 longSkewFraction = ((sizeOpenedTotal + _additionalSkew) * 1e18) / stableCollateralTotal;
304: 
305:             if (longSkewFraction > skewFractionMax) revert FlatcoinErrors.MaxSkewReached(longSkewFraction);
306:         }
307:     }

```

## Impact
1) break part of core functionality
2) users might be liquidated out as they can't increase margin in time.
