# Owner may make leverage total skew fraction larger than skewFractionMax unintentionally

## Summary
Owner may make leverage total skew fraction larger than skewFractionMax unintentionally by updating skewFractionMax.

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol owner can call [setSkewFractionMax(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/FlatcoinVault.sol#L339) function to update **skewFractionMax**:
```solidity
    function setSkewFractionMax(uint256 _skewFractionMax) public onlyOwner {
        if (_skewFractionMax < 1e18) revert FlatcoinErrors.InvalidSkewFractionMax(_skewFractionMax);

        skewFractionMax = _skewFractionMax;
    }
```
As we can see from above, **skewFractionMax** is updated a new value directly without a double-check. This can be problematic when owner decrease the value. Consider the following scenario:
1. Owner submits a transaction to lower the **skewFractionMax**, due to network congestion, owner's transaction is not executed immediately;
2. At the same time, a trader announces a leverage adjust to add more size to a position;
3. After the minimum time delay, trader's transaction is executed and position is adjusted, leverage total skew fraction is almost the same as **skewFractionMax**;
4. Owner's transaction gets executed, **skewFractionMax** is updated to a much lower value;
5. Invariant is broken because leverage total skew fraction is higher than **skewFractionMax**.

## Impact
Owner may make leverage total skew fraction larger than skewFractionMax unintentionally.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a double-check after **skewFractionMax** is updated to ensure the invariant won't be broken.
```diff
    function setSkewFractionMax(uint256 _skewFractionMax) public onlyOwner {
        if (_skewFractionMax < 1e18) revert FlatcoinErrors.InvalidSkewFractionMax(_skewFractionMax);

        skewFractionMax = _skewFractionMax;

+       checkSkewMax(0);
    }
```
