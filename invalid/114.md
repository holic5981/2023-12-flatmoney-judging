# Keepers can select transactions based on keeper fee

## Summary
Keepers have the capability to prioritize transactions according to the keeper fee associated with them, often favoring transactions with higher keeper fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
This preference for higher keeper fees can result in an accumulation of slow and pending transactions within the protocol.

## Impact
Consequently, users who have placed limit or leverage orders may experience situations where their transactions remain unfulfilled due to prolonged processing times. This delay may compel users to cancel their transactions as they reach the maximum allowable transaction duration, potentially resulting in missed profit opportunities for the users and the protocol.
