# Liquidate other user's positions without intent or permissions

## Summary

A user's position can be liquidated by anyone as long as they have the tokenID for the NFT representing the position. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `liquidate()` function does not check if the provided `tokenID` has an associated order or if the caller is permitted to liquidate the position. This enables malicious users to liquidate **any** long position in the protocol.

## Impact

- A user's position is liquidated without their permission or intent.
- Keepers will not get fees for a task they are supposed to do (closing the position).

## Code Snippet

- [src/LiquidationModule#L85-L177](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LiquidationModule.sol#L85-L177)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Ensure that a position has an order to close associated with it before liquidating it. 
- Ensure that operation such as closing a position is done by keepers through appropriate functions.
