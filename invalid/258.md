# Front-Running Occurs in executeOrder function

## Summary
In the `executeOrder` function, the executor of the order is determined by `msg.sender`, which is the address that calls the function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `executeOrder` function does not appear to have mechanisms in place to prevent front-running. Since it relies on `msg.sender` to determine who is executing the order, anyone who can see the transaction before it is mined has the opportunity to front-run it.

## Impact
Poc:

1. A user submits a transaction to execute an order with specific terms.
2. A miner or observer sees this pending transaction in the mempool (the collection of all pending transactions).
3. The malicious actor creates their own transaction with a higher gas price to execute the same order.
4. Because miners prioritize transactions with higher gas prices, the attacker's transaction is confirmed first.
5. The attacker benefits from the conditions intended for the original transaction, potentially at a more favorable price.
