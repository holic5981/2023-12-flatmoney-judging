# _getMaxAge() can underflow or overflow

## Summary
The provided function _getMaxAge() calculates the time difference between the current block's timestamp and a given timestamp _executableAtTime. The result is then cast to uint32. There is potential vulnerability in the cast from uint64 to uint32.

## Vulnerability Detail

 **Overflow**: If the time difference is too large, it may exceed the maximum value representable by uint32 (which is 2^32 - 1). In such cases, the result will overflow, and you'll get an unexpected and likely incorrect value.


## Impact
 This can affect the calculation for `stableCollateralPerShare()` in both deposit and withdraw. there by causing user to fewer LPs on deposit or more amountOut on withdraw

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To handle this, you may want to check whether the time difference is within the representable range of uint32 before performing the cast, and handle overflow scenarios appropriately.

` function _getMaxAge(uint64 _executableAtTime) 
internal view returns (uint32 _maxAge) {
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - _executableAtTime;
        require(timeDifference <= type(uint32).max, "Time difference exceeds uint32 range");
        return uint32(timeDifference);
    }
