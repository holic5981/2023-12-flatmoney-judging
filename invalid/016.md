# PerpMath::borrowing fee is not deducted from margin collateral during margin settlement calculation

## Summary
In `_getPositionSummary()` of `PerpMath.sol` library the borrowing fee is added to margin collateral instead of deducting while calculating the `marginAfterSettlement` of `PositionSummary` struct.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `PerpMath.sol` library we have a function named `_accruedFunding()` which returns the borrowing fee of a particular position. The borrowing fee should be deducted from the collateral of the trader and sent to LPs. But in `_getPositionSummary()` while calculating the `marginAfterSettlement` we are adding it to margin collateral instead of deducting it.
The problematic line is this:
```solidity
                marginAfterSettlement: int256(position.marginDeposited) + profitLoss + accruedFunding
```

## Impact
As the code adding the borrowing fee instead of deducting the fee will not be deducted from the margin collateral of that trader during liquidation. Additionally the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LiquidationModule.sol#L94), for whether the position is liquidateable or not, may fail for that position because in `PerpMath::_canLiquidate()` the `marginAfterSettlement` is accounted to check whether the `marginAfterSettlement` is greater than `lMargin` or not and depending on this comparison the boolean value is returned, we can see the code [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/libraries/PerpMath.sol#L370), so if `marginAfterSettlement` is calculated wrongly, i.e if the `accruedFunding` is added to it instead of deducting from it it's value will increase so may the value of `margineAfterSettlement` be greater than `lmargin` so the position, which should be liquidate, will not be liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deduct the `accruedFunding` from margin collateral of the trader instead of adding it while calculating `marginAfterSettlement` in `_getPositionSummary()`.
