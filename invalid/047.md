# FlatcoinVault::wrong accounting of net PnL

## Summary
There is a wrong accounting of net PnL in `updateGlobalPositionData()` in `FlatcoinVault.sol` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `updateGlobalPositionData()` there is a internal call to `_updateStableCollateralTotal()` where net PnL is passed as argument. However, the net PnL is passed as negetive value:
```solidity
        _updateStableCollateralTotal(-profitLossTotal);
```
While calculating net PnL we are substracting the previous price, i.e the price when the position was opened, from current price of asset, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/libraries/PerpMath.sol#L196):
```solidity
        int256 priceShift = int256(price) - int256(globalPosition.lastPrice);
```
So, if the price goes down then the `priceShift` will be negative, as a result the net PnL will be negative too. because net PnL is calculated like this:
```solidity
        return (int256(globalPosition.sizeOpenedTotal) * (priceShift)) / int256(price);
```
So, if the net PnL is negative and as it is passed with -ve sign to `_updateStableCollateral()` it will increase the stable collateral total amount instead of decreasing it & if positive then it will decrease stable collateral total.
## Impact
As net PnL is passed to `_updateStableCollateral()` with -ve sign it will increase the stable collateral total instead of decreasing and decrease instead of increasing it.

## Recommendation
Pass the `profitLossTotal` as +ve value to `_updateStableCollateralTotal()`.
