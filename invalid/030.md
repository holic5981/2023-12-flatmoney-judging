# Inadequate Validation in ERC721 Token Management for Leveraged Positions

## Summary
The **DelayedOrder** contract lacks essential checks to verify the ownership of ERC721 tokens (representing leveraged positions) in **announceLeverageAdjust** and **announceLeverageClose** functions. An unauthorized user could potentially lock and manipulate tokens they do not own, as the contract currently does not validate if the caller is the actual token owner.
## Vulnerability Detail
If for example User A tries to adjust or close a position linked to **tokenId = 123** that they do not own, the contract erroneously allows this operation, leading to unauthorized adjustments.

```solidity
function announceLeverageAdjust(
    uint256 tokenId,
    // ... other parameters
) external whenNotPaused {
    leverageModule.lock(tokenId); // Missing ownership check
    // ...
}
```

## Impact

- **Unauthorized Position Adjustments:** Users could potentially manipulate positions tied to ERC721 tokens they do not own, leading to unauthorized changes in leveraged positions.
- **Market Integrity Risk:** The ability to adjust or close positions without proper ownership verification could undermine the integrity of the trading system, leading to a loss of trust among users.
- **Potential for Financial Exploitation**: Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to destabilize positions of other users for personal gain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**1. Ownership Verification:**
Implement an ownership check in the ERC721 handling functions.

**2.Position Status Validation:**
Verify the position's status associated with the token before allowing any operations.

```solidity
function announceLeverageAdjust(
    uint256 tokenId,
    // ... other parameters
) external whenNotPaused {
    require(leverageModule.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Caller is not the token owner");
    // Additional checks for position status
    // ...
    leverageModule.lock(tokenId);
}
```
By introducing these checks, the contract will significantly improve the security around ERC721 token operations, ensuring only legitimate owners can adjust or close their leveraged positions
