# Discrepancy between keeper and oracle module staleness periods can result in unexpected reverts and unfair liquidations

## Summary

Discrepancy between keeper and oracle module staleness periods can result in unexpected reverts and unfair liquidations

## Vulnerability Detail

Various critical functions in the protocol (e.g. announce functions in the delayed order contract) rely on the both the keeper fee and the oracle module to deliver fresh chainlink price feeds. Let's take a look at both of them


the keeper fee contract uses chainlink price to calculate to keeper's fee shown here

```solidity

 function getKeeperFee() public view returns (uint256 keeperFeeCollateral) {
        uint256 ethPrice18;
        {
            (, int256 ethPrice, , uint256 ethPriceupdatedAt, ) = _ethOracle.latestRoundData();
            if (block.timestamp >= ethPriceupdatedAt + _STALENESS_PERIOD) revert FlatcoinErrors.ETHPriceStale();
```

note the check made to see if the feed isn't stale 

```solidity
  if (block.timestamp >= ethPriceupdatedAt + _STALENESS_PERIOD) revert FlatcoinErrors.ETHPriceStale();
```

 ```uint256 private constant _STALENESS_PERIOD = 1 days;```



Now let's take a look at the oracle module 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/bba4f077a64f43fbd565f8983388d0e985cb85db/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L141-L149



Just like the keeper fee contract , there is a check to make sure that the feed isn't stale.

```solidity 

   if (block.timestamp > timestamp + onchainOracle.maxAge)
            revert FlatcoinErrors.PriceStale(FlatcoinErrors.PriceSource.OnChain);
```


Also, take a look at the config to see that the maxage (which is incorrect) would look like


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/bba4f077a64f43fbd565f8983388d0e985cb85db/flatcoin-v1/scripts/deployment/configs/OracleModule.config.js#L6


The issue here is that both the keeper fee and the oracle module's staleness periods are not consistent. This means that there can be situations where a feed is too stale for the oracle module but fine for the keeper. This mismatch will ultimately result in reverts in some situations which can be devastating for users as some will not have a chance to shore up their position and avoid unfair liquidations when a price feed becomes fresh enough for both contracts (keeper and oracle)


## Impact

Critical protocol functions will revert at times where it shouldn't, potentially causing unfair liquidations for users

## Recommendation

Make sure that the staleness period for both the keeper fee and the oracle modules are the same
