# Risk of token loss due to unchecked minAmoutOut vulnerability

## Summary
Unchecked `minAmountOut` set by the user can be arbitrarily low, for example 0 or 1, which poses a significant risk of losing tokens if `minAmountOut` is required to be paid to them.

## Vulnerability Detail
Unchecked `minAmountOut` set by the user can be arbitrarily low, even down to 0 or 1, which effectively bypasses any high slippage checks, exposing the system to potential exploitation. Based on the code `snipet` below the expression will always be false provided `quotedAmount` is greater than `minAmountOut`.

## Impact
Users are at risk of losing their tokens if minAmountOut needs to be paid to them due to the unchecked and potentially low value set by the user.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the `quotedAmount` as the `minAmountOut` for the user to mitigate the risk of exploitation and potential loss of tokens.
