# Incorrect Validation Of latestRoundData Function Can Lead to Stale Price Issue.

## Summary
When `OracleModule#_getOnchainPrice()` fetches the price from Chainlink, it misses a very important check recommended by the Chainlink protocol to ensure the data is fresh and accurate.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_getOnchainPrice()` function depends on Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` but does not verify round completeness. The protocol developers (according to Discord chat) plan to set `onchainOracle.maxAge` to 24 hours and 10 seconds. This means that the price is considered not stale only when **block.timestamp <= updatedAt (Last Time the price was updated) + onchainOracle.maxAge (24H + 10 seconds)**.

```solidity
(, int256 _price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
timestamp = updatedAt;
if (block.timestamp > timestamp + onchainOracle.maxAge) 
    revert FlatcoinErrors.PriceStale(FlatcoinErrors.PriceSource.OnChain);
```

## Impact
Chainlink could return stale data, which the protocol might accept when the keeper execute pending orders or liquidate, even though it primarily relies on Pyth's offchain price. However, if **offchainInvalid == true**, the on-chain price returned might not be accurate.

This issue for example could result to the liquidation of users who should not be liquidated when the `canLiquidate` function is called.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following checks and reply on the returned value from latestRoundData to verify for price stale instead of onchainOracle.maxAge set by the protocol admin.
```solidity

(uint80 roundId , int256 _price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();

require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Price Stale");

```
