# Users who want to liquidate can be frontrun

## Summary
All profitable for liquidation positions can be frontrun by MEV bots. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Both liquidation functions, allow users to call them and liquidate positions which pass the liquidation criteria, however in reality all profitable positions will be frontrun by bots leading the users to only lose gases calling them, hence lose trust in the project. 

## Impact
Users who want to earn extra fees by liquidating position will end up losing gas fees and not earning anything.
