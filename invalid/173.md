# MIN_LIQUIDITY can lower than intended

## Summary

The `MIN_LIQUIDITY `  variable at [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/bba4f077a64f43fbd565f8983388d0e985cb85db/flatcoin-v1/src/StableModule.sol#L30) can be lower than whats written.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MIN_LIQUIDITY ` is a constant variable that is meant to be constant and not change, the comment there says that:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_LIQUIDITY = 10_000; // minimum totalSupply that is allowable
```
which means that the `totalSupply` should not be lower than that amount.

The `MIN_LIQUIDITY ` was checked in the [`executeDeposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/bba4f077a64f43fbd565f8983388d0e985cb85db/flatcoin-v1/src/StableModule.sol#L79) function to ensure that the minted amount is not lower than the `MIN_LIQUIDITY ` : 
```solidity
 if (totalSupply() < MIN_LIQUIDITY) {
            revert FlatcoinErrors.AmountTooSmall({amount: totalSupply(), minAmount: MIN_LIQUIDITY});
        }
```
The issue here is that the same check is not in place during withdrawal and the withdraw amount was directly pass in to the `_burn` function allowing the `totalSupply` to be lower than the `MIN_LIQUIDITY `

 

## Impact
The impact here is that the `totalSupply` can be lower than the said `MIN_LIQUIDITY ` that should be always be the minimum allowed as the comment says 
```solidity
  // minimum totalSupply that is allowable
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The sponsor confirm to me that that : 
```solidity
// I believe it's an old artifact no longer required. It was put in to avoid rounding errors and inflation attack but it's not really relevant anymore.
```

it should be removed then and also the same check in the `executeDeposit` should also be removed.
