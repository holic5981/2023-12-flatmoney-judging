# Close position trader fee can be bypassing

## Summary

User can pay less fee for position close using limit order.

## Vulnerability Detail

Limit order close fee calculated using current position size when order announced in `announceLimitOrder`
```solidity
uint256 tradeFee = ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).getTradeFee(
    vault.getPosition(tokenId).additionalSize
);
```

When executing in `_closePosition` function previously calculated fee are used
```solidity
order.orderData = abi.encode(
    FlatcoinStructs.AnnouncedLeverageClose({
        tokenId: tokenId,
        minFillPrice: minFillPrice,
        tradeFee: _limitOrder.tradeFee
    })
);
```

But in the moment of execution position size can be greater (or smaller) because of adjustment hence incorrect fee are applied. 

User can open position with minimal amount, announce limit and adjust position to desirable size. When limit order executed, he will pay minimal fee for arbitrary large position close.
