# Trade fee is miscalculated in `LimitOrder`

## Summary

When the user chooses to close the position using `announceLeverageClose`, trade fee is calculated from the price at which the user closes the position. But in 'announceLimitOrder', trade fee is calculated from the price at which the user set the limit order, which 

Trade fee in `LimitOrder` should be determined by the position size at the take-profit and stop-loss prices, but it is actually miscalculated by user's position size when he calls `announceLimitOrder`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `DelayedOrder`, trade fee is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LeverageModule.sol#L427-L430) based on the the size of the position of the user's announce operation:

    //LeverageModule.sol-L427
    function getTradeFee(uint256 _size) external view returns (uint256 _tradeFee) {
        return levTradingFee._multiplyDecimal(_size);
    }

    //LimitOrder.sol-L58
    function announceLimitOrder(uint256 tokenId, uint256 priceLowerThreshold, uint256 priceUpperThreshold) external {
        uint64 executableAtTime = _prepareAnnouncementOrder();
        address positionOwner = _checkPositionOwner(tokenId);
        _checkThresholds(priceLowerThreshold, priceUpperThreshold);
        //@Audit tradeFee is miscalculated
        uint256 tradeFee = ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).getTradeFee(
            vault.getPosition(tokenId).additionalSize
        );

        _limitOrderClose[tokenId] = FlatcoinStructs.Order({
            orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LimitClose,
            orderData: abi.encode(
                FlatcoinStructs.LimitClose(tokenId, priceLowerThreshold, priceUpperThreshold, tradeFee)
            ),
            keeperFee: 0, // Not applicable for limit orders. Keeper fee will be determined at execution time.
            executableAtTime: executableAtTime
        });

        // Lock the NFT belonging to this position so that it can't be transferred to someone else.
        ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).lock(tokenId);

        emit FlatcoinEvents.OrderAnnounced({
            account: positionOwner,
            orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LimitClose,
            keeperFee: 0
        });
    }

But, as price changes affect users' position size, when a Take Profit order is triggered, less trade fee is charged and when a Stop Loss order is triggered, more trade fee is charged. (compare with `announceLeverageClose`)

## Impact

The trade fee of every limit order is miscalculated, putting the protocol or all users at a significant loss in a one-sided market.

## Code Snippet

Trade fee is correctly calculated in `announceLeverageClose`:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Trade fee in `LimitOrder` should be determined by the position size at the take-profit and stop-loss prices.
