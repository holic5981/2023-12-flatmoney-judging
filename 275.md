# Division Before Multiplication in Fixed-Point Arithmetic

## Summary
In the `getCurrentSkew` function of the `FlatcoinVault` contract, the division by `1e18` is performed after subtracting `int256(sizeOpenedTotal) * unrecordedFunding`. This could lead to a less precise calculation due to the division truncating the result. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Here's the relevant line of code:

```solidity
return int256(sizeOpenedTotal) - int256(stableCollateralTotal) - (int256(sizeOpenedTotal) * unrecordedFunding) / 1e18;
```

In this line, the multiplication `int256(sizeOpenedTotal) * unrecordedFunding` is performed first, and then the result is divided by `1e18`. The issue here is that division in Solidity (and in many other programming languages) is integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest integer. This can lead to a loss of precision, especially when dealing with large numbers or numbers with many decimal places.

## Impact
Precision loss in smart contracts can have significant implications. In the context of the `FlatcoinVault` contract, the `getCurrentSkew` function is used to calculate the current skew of the market, taking into account unaccrued funding. This skew is used in various calculations related to funding rates, fees, and other critical aspects of the contract.

If the skew is not calculated accurately due to precision loss, it could lead to inaccuracies in these subsequent calculations. This could potentially disadvantage certain parties or disrupt the intended functioning of the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To minimize precision loss in fixed-point arithmetic, it's generally better to perform multiplication before division. This is because multiplication can increase the precision of the result, while division can decrease it.

In the case of the `getCurrentSkew` function, rearranging the operations so that the division by `1e18` is performed last could help to minimize precision loss. Here's how the revised line of code might look:

```solidity
return int256(sizeOpenedTotal) - int256(stableCollateralTotal) - int256(sizeOpenedTotal * unrecordedFunding / 1e18);
```

In this revised line, the multiplication and division are performed together before the subtraction, which should help to maintain the precision of the calculation. However, it's important to note that this change could potentially introduce overflow issues, so appropriate safeguards should be put in place to prevent this.
