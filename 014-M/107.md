# Need timely update stableCollateralTotal before checkSkewMax()

## Summary
Need timely update stableCollateralTotal before checkSkewMax()

## Vulnerability Detail
In function checkSkewMax(), skew's calculation is based on stableCollateralTotal. In function executeOpen(), we checkSkewMax() at first, and then update stableCollateralTotal, which means checkSkewMax() does not work as expected.

## Impact
checkSkewMax() does not work as expected. Because stableCollateralTotal is out-dated.
