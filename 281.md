# Reentrancy Vulnerability in FlatcoinVault Contract

## Summary

The `sendCollateral` function in `FlatcoinVault` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls external contracts without checks. This could allow attackers to drain funds or manipulate state.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is high. A successful exploit could:

- Drain collateral tokens from the contract
- Manipulate contract state for attacker profit
- Break contract assumptions and logic

## Exploit Scenario

An example exploit scenario:

1. Attacker deploys a malicious contract
2. `FlatcoinVault` calls `sendCollateral` to pay out collateral to the malicious contract 
3. The malicious contract has a fallback function that calls back into `sendCollateral`
4. The reentrant call succeeds since state is not yet locked
5. More collateral is drained via the second call
6. This can repeat multiple times until the contract balance is drained

## Vulnerable Code

The vulnerability arises from `sendCollateral` calling external contracts without checks:

```solidity
function sendCollateral(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyAuthorizedModule {
  collateral.safeTransfer(to, amount); 
}
```
## Code Snippet

## Recommended Mitigation

To mitigate this, `sendCollateral` should apply a reentrancy guard or follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, e.g.:

```solidity
bool locked;

modifier noReentrancy() {
  require(!locked, "No reentrancy");

  locked = true;
  _;
  locked = false;
}

function sendCollateral() external noReentrancy {
  // ...
} 
```

This would prevent reentrant calls, fixing the vulnerability.
