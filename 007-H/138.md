# The owner of any position can close the position with the minimum tradeFee regardless of the additionalSize of the position

## Summary

A position needs to go through two tx to be closed:

1. Announce leverage close intent via [[announceLeverageClose](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L317)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L317)/[[announceLimitOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L58)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L58).

2. execute any valid pending order via [[executeOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L378-L381)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L378-L381)/[[executeLimitOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L119-L122)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L119-L122).

The `tradeFee` of an order or limit order is not determined in tx2, but calculated in tx1 based on the `additionalSize` of the position at that time.

Due to this issue, any user can greatly reduce the `tradeFee` of a limit order. Because the `tradeFee` of all orders is given to the short party(stable LP), this can be regarded as a loss to the short party.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: flatcoin-v1\src\LimitOrder.sol
58:     function announceLimitOrder(uint256 tokenId, uint256 priceLowerThreshold, uint256 priceUpperThreshold) external {
59:         uint64 executableAtTime = _prepareAnnouncementOrder();
60:         address positionOwner = _checkPositionOwner(tokenId);
61:         _checkThresholds(priceLowerThreshold, priceUpperThreshold);
62:->       uint256 tradeFee = ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).getTradeFee(
63:             vault.getPosition(tokenId).additionalSize
64:         );
65: 
66:         _limitOrderClose[tokenId] = FlatcoinStructs.Order({
67:             orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LimitClose,
68:             orderData: abi.encode(
69:->               FlatcoinStructs.LimitClose(tokenId, priceLowerThreshold, priceUpperThreshold, tradeFee)
70:             ),
71:             keeperFee: 0, // Not applicable for limit orders. Keeper fee will be determined at execution time.
72:             executableAtTime: executableAtTime
73:         });
......
83:     }
```

L62, `tradeFee` is equal to the `additionalSize` of the position at this moment multiplied by [[levTradingFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LeverageModule.sol#L428)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LeverageModule.sol#L428) (0.1%).

L69, encode `tradeFee` into `orderData` and write to `_limitOrderClose[tokenId]`.

**Since the limit order has no expiration date, it will always exist unless canceled by the owner of the position or executed**. 

Consider the following scenario:

```data
levTradingFee is 1e16 (0.1%)  
leverageMin is 1.5e18 (1.5X)  
leverageMax is 25e18 (25X)  
minExecutabilityAge is 5s  
maxExecutabilityAge is 60s
```

For the sake of simplicity, some details have been omitted and do not affect the validity of this issue.

1.  Alice calls `announceLeverageOpen` to open a position, `margin` is 10e18, and `additionalSize` is `10e18 * leverageMin = 15e18`. An order to open a position enters pending.
2.  After `minExecutabilityAge` passed, an keeper executed the order. Alice gets a new position A: `positionA.additionalSize is 15e18`. The current collateral price is 1000e18.
3.  Alice calls `announceLimitOrder` for position A, `priceLowerThreshold = 900e18, priceUpperThreshold = 1100e18`. A new limit order enters pending, and it's `tradeFee` is `positionA.additionalSize * levTradingFee = 15e18 * 0.1% = 0.015e18`.
4.  Alice calls `announceLeverageAdjust` for position A, with the purpose of increasing `positionA.additionalSize`. An order to adjust positionA enters pending.
5.  After `minExecutabilityAge` passed, an keeper executed the adjustment order. At this time, `positionA.additionalSize is 200e18`.
6.  As time passes, the collateral price pumps to 1101e18. aliceâ€™s limit order is successfully executed. **However, `tradeFee` is 0.015e18. It should be 200e18*0.1%=0.2e18. They differ by 13.3333X**.

## Impact

The `tradeFee` of all orders/limit orders is given to the short party. This problem reduces the revenue of the short party. It is therefore considered a loss of their funds. The scenario already described does not require technical skills and can be easily accomplished with any EOA. The tradeFee loss caused by one limit order may be small, but imagine the loss caused by many limit orders, which is significant.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The real tradeFee should be calculated in `LeverageModule.executeClose`, based on `position.additionalSize` at that time.
