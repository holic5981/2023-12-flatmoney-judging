# Potential for Reentrancy Attacks

## Summary
The **DelayedOrder** contract's functions, particularly those involving token transfers, may be susceptible to reentrancy attacks. This vulnerability can occur if the contract interacts with external contracts (e.g., ERC20 token transfers) without proper reentrancy guards in place, potentially allowing attackers to drain funds or disrupt contract logic.
## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose the contract executes a token transfer to an external address, which is a contract capable of making recursive calls back to **DelayedOrder**. If **DelayedOrder** doesn't properly prevent reentrant calls, the external contract could exploit this to repeatedly withdraw funds or manipulate state variables.
## Impact
Imagine an attacker uses a malicious contract to receive a token transfer from **DelayedOrder**. Upon receiving tokens, the malicious contract calls back into **DelayedOrder's** withdrawal function, initiating another transfer before the first transaction completes. This could be repeated, draining funds or causing unintended state changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Implementation of Reentrancy Guards:**
Utilize **ReentrancyGuard** from OpenZeppelin to safeguard functions that transfer tokens or interact with external contracts.

```solidity
import {ReentrancyGuard} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract DelayedOrder is ReentrancyGuard {
    // ...

    function withdrawTokens(address to, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
        // Withdrawal logic
    }
}
```
Applying **ReentrancyGuard** ensures that functions cannot be re-entered while they're still executing, significantly mitigating the risk of reentrancy attacks.
