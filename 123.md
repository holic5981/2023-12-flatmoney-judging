# A user can get liquidated immediately after a pause

## Summary

A user can get liquidated immediately after a pause 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol gives the owner the ability to pause the modules shown here

```solidity
    function pauseModule(bytes32 _moduleKey) external onlyOwner {
        isModulePaused[_moduleKey] = true;
    }
```

This is accompanied by a check in each module whether the module has been paused or not.

```solidity
  modifier whenNotPaused() {
        if (vault.isModulePaused(MODULE_KEY)) revert FlatcoinErrors.Paused(MODULE_KEY);
        _;
    }
```

. This can be done to upgrade the contract, for maintenance,  or to protect users from high volatility. However, a lack of a grace period after the protocol has been paused can lead to unfair liquidations and a loss of funds.

Let's say that the leverage module is paused. And during the time that the protocol is paused, there is very high volatility on the price of collateral causing some previously healthy positions to be liquidable. During this time, users has no chance to shore up their positions. As a result, as soon as the leverage module is unpaused, those positions can be instantly liquidated. Users will not have a chance to respond because even if they can front run the liquidator, executing the order is a 2 step process (announce first, wait and then execute) while liquidations can happen right away 

```solidity
   function liquidate(
        uint256 tokenID,
        bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData
    ) external payable whenNotPaused updatePythPrice(vault, msg.sender, priceUpdateData) {
        liquidate(tokenID);
    }
```

## Impact

User can lose funds after the protocol has been paused

## Recommendation

Add a grace period after the protocol has been paused to give users a chance to shore up their positions after the protocol is paused
