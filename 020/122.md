# Before executeAdjust, protocol should first transfer the fee to the vault

## Summary

Before executeAdjust, protocol should first transfer the fee to the vault

## Vulnerability Detail

In function _executeLeverageAdjust, LeverageModule is going to executeAdjust. And In function executeAdjust, vault needs to send fees to keeper. 

```solidity
// Sending keeper fee from order contract to the executor.
        vault.sendCollateral({to: _keeper, amount: _order.keeperFee});
```

However, in function _executeLeverageAdjust, fees is transfered to vault after the executeAdjust, which is incorrect.

## Impact

executeAdjust may be DOSed as no enough fees.
