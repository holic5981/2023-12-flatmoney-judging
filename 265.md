# Deadlock could potentially occur in  announceLeverageClose and announceLeverageAdjust Functions

## Summary
In the context of the `announceLeverageClose` and `announceLeverageAdjust` functions, a deadlock could potentially occur due to the use of the `lock` function. The `lock` function is used to prevent a resource (in this case, a token) from being accessed by other processes while it is being used. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. A user calls the `announceLeverageClose` or `announceLeverageAdjust` function, which in turn calls the `lock` function to lock a token.
2. If the function fails after the token is locked but before it is released, the token remains locked.
3. Any subsequent attempts to access the locked token (for example, by calling the `announceLeverageClose` or `announceLeverageAdjust` function again) will fail because the token is still locked from the previous call.
4. This results in a deadlock situation where the token cannot be accessed or unlocked because the process that locked it is waiting for resources to complete.

## Impact
DoS

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement robust exception handling to ensure that if a function fails, any resources it has locked are properly released.
2. Implement a timeout for locks. If a process has held a lock for longer than the specified timeout period, the lock is automatically released.
