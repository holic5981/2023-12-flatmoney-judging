# A user can bypass the locking of tokens in announced orders, by unlocking it in the LimitOrder contract

## Summary
When a user calls `DelayedOrder::announceLeverageAdjust` or `announceLeverageClose`, the position NFT is locked to prevent it from being transferred while there is a pending order. However, the user can bypass this lock by creating a limit order and immediately cancelling it.

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a limit order via `LimitOrder::announceLimitOrder`, the token is locked.

Then when cancelling the limit order via `LimitOrder::cancelLimitOrder`, the token is unlocked without checking if there is an announced close/adjust order, instead only checking if there is an existing limit order.

```javascript
function cancelLimitOrder(uint256 tokenId) external {
        address positionOwner = _checkPositionOwner(tokenId);
        _checkLimitCloseOrder(tokenId);
        delete _limitOrderClose[tokenId];

        // Unlock the ERC721 position NFT to allow for transfers.
@>      ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY))
        .unlock(tokenId);

        emit FlatcoinEvents.OrderCancelled({account: positionOwner, orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LimitClose});
    }
```

Because of this, a user who has an announced and pending leverageAdjust/leverageClose order can simply create a limit order, cancel it in the same transaction in order to unlock their position's token.

## Impact
Tokens which are supposed to be locked while orders are pending can be unlocked. This means that they can transfer the token to someone else while a leverageClose/leverageAdjust order is pending. Then once the order is executed, they still receive the remaining settled margin.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/LimitOrder.sol#L94

## Proof of Concept
Summary:
1. User with a leverage position announces to either adjust or close their position. (This is supposed to lock their token until the order is executed)
2. User creates a limit close order, and then immediately cancels the order.
3. Token is now unlocked, even though the announced order still exists.

To run this PoC:
1. Add the following code to `flatcoin-v1/test/unit` in the audit repo
2. run `forge test --mt test_unlockToken`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `DelayedOrder::cancelLimitOrder`, add a check to ensure that there a no announced order leverageAdjust or leverageClose for that tokenId, and if so, don't unlock the token.

```diff
function cancelLimitOrder(uint256 tokenId) external {
+       IDelayedOrder delayedOrder = IDelayedOrder(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys.__DELAYED_ORDER_KEY));
        address positionOwner = _checkPositionOwner(tokenId);
        _checkLimitCloseOrder(tokenId);
        delete _limitOrderClose[tokenId];


        // Unlock the ERC721 position NFT to allow for transfers.
+        FlatcoinStructs.OrderType orderType = delayedOrder.getAnnouncedOrder(msg.sender).orderType;
+        if (orderType != FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LeverageClose && orderType != FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LeverageAdjust) {
            ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).unlock(tokenId);
+        }

        emit FlatcoinEvents.OrderCancelled({account: positionOwner, orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LimitClose});
    }
```
