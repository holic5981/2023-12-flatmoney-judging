# Fallback to onchain oracle wrongly implemented

## Summary
Not working oracle fallback mechanism leads to a stalled contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per a [developer's note](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L159), it has been specified that the fallback in the _getPrice function should default to the on-chain oracle. 

However, there is an issue in the implementation. When invoking the [getPriceNoOlderThan in the _getOffChainPrice function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L167) is triggering an error, the returned value [`invalid` is the to `true`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L182). Consequently, the values returned for price and timestamp in this situation will be set to 0, as initialized in the _getOffchainPrice function declaration.

Due to these assigned values, the [_getPrice function will revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L113) and never fallback to the on-chain oracle in the case where [offchainInvalid is true in the _getPrice function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L125-L128).

## Impact
Stalled contract. Until the off-chain Oracle is restored, certain actions, such as announcing leverage adjustments, announcing leverage closure, execute open, execute adjust, execute close, close limited order, liquidations, or etc. cannot be processed.

## Code Snippet
See provided links above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Review and revise the Oracle fallback mechanism to ensure that a fallback to the on-chain Oracle is possible in the event that the off-chain Oracle ceases to function.
