# During liquidation, global position data is updated with the wrong price

## Summary
During liquidation, global position data is updated with `position.lastPrice` rather than `currentPrice`. This will lead to incorrect PnL calculations later on, disrupting proper protocol functionality. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `LiquidationModule::liquidate()`, when `updateGlobalPositionData()` is called, the `price` parameter is set to `position.lastPrice`

```javascript
vault.updateGlobalPositionData({
            price: position.lastPrice,
            marginDelta: -(int256(position.marginDeposited) + positionSummary.accruedFunding),
            additionalSizeDelta: -int256(position.additionalSize)
        });
```

This value represents either the initial price at which the position was created, or the price of the latest adjustment to the position. 

This is an outdated price value and the local `currentPrice` variable which was obtained within the same transaction should be used instead, to update the global position data correctly.

## Impact
Incorrect PnL calculations in the future, since `FlatcoinVault::_globalPositions.lastPrice` will be incorrect. This can lead to unwarranted liquidations, and also not being able to liquidate underwater positions, potentially leading to protocol insolvency.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
vault.updateGlobalPositionData({
-           price: position.lastPrice,
+           price: currentPrice,
            marginDelta: -(int256(position.marginDeposited) + positionSummary.accruedFunding),
            additionalSizeDelta: -int256(position.additionalSize)
        });
```
