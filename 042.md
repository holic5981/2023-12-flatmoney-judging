# No check on L2 sequencer can result in unfair liquidations

## Summary

 No check on L2 sequencer can result in unfair liquidations


## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidate function allows a user to liquidate a position

```solidity
  function liquidate(uint256 tokenId) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused liquidationInvariantChecks(vault, tokenId) {
        FlatcoinStructs.Position memory position = vault.getPosition(tokenId);

        (uint256 currentPrice, ) = IOracleModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._ORACLE_MODULE_KEY)).getPrice();

        // Settle funding fees accrued till now.
        vault.settleFundingFees();

        // Check if the position can indeed be liquidated.
        if (!canLiquidate(tokenId)) revert FlatcoinErrors.CannotLiquidate(tokenId);
```

then it makes several checks to make sure if a position can be liquidated shown here

 However, there is no check whether the L2 sequencer has been recently shut down. This can have severe consequences. Let's say that a Bob has  a healthy position and then the sequencer is shutdown for a long period of time. During that time, there is significant price movement for rETH, making Bob's position unhealthy. As soon as the sequencer is back up online, Bob is immediately liquidated, without him ever having a chance to shore up his position.

It is recommended to have a grace period, after a shutdown to give users time to shore up their positions

## Impact
Users can be unfairly liquidated due to an L2 shutdown
