# OracleModule verifies even invalid Pyth network price against Chainlink price

## Summary

Pyth and chainlink price difference checked even if pyth price is invalid or not used

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_getOffchainPrice` function zero price or price with low confidence returned along with invalid flag = true if some error occured quering pyth price. But in `_getPrice` pyth price checked against chainlink price regardless of the flag and reverting if check fails. Basicly it checks invalid price agains chainlink price and most likely fail.

This is not immediately obvious why pyth price can fail (although it can be updated by anyone), nevetheless I believe this is deserve medium severity because this issue can be considered as not checking chainlink staleness threshold and similar issues.

## Impact

If Pyth price is invalid oracle most likely fail to fallback to chainlink price DOSing critical protocol functionality

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check price difference only if pyth price is valid OR only if pyth price actually used
