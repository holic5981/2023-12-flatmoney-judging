# improper priceDiff usage when offchain price is invalid

## Summary
improper priceDiff usage when offchain price is invalid

## Vulnerability Detail
In OracleModule::_getPrice(), we have two price, on-chain price from Chainlink and off-chain price from Pyth. And we will make sure price difference between on-chain price and off-chain price is less than maxDiffPercent.
The maxDiffPercent check should check price difference on condition that both prices are valid.

For example, there is something wrong in Pyth price, and has told us offchainInvalid is true. In this scenario, offchainPrice value can be any value, we should not use this value to do anything. It's possible to revert via FlatcoinErrors.PriceMismatch error. In this case, we should make use of on-chain price only.

## Impact
If offchian price is invalid, it could cause revert even if we have one good on-chain price.

## Recommendation
If offchainInvalid is true, skip maxDiffPercent check.
