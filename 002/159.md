# No check if Base L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Base requires checking the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the Price Feed, If the Base Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_getOnchainPrice()` function, used within `_getPrice()`, returns the on-chain price if `offchainInvalid == true` or   when `offchainTime < onchainTime`

[_getPrice function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L115-L128)
```solidity
if (offchainInvalid == false) {
            // return the freshest price
            if (offchainTime >= onchainTime) {
                price = offchainPrice;
                timestamp = offchainTime;
                offchain = true;
            } else {
                price = onchainPrice;
                timestamp = onchainTime;
            }
        } else {
            price = onchainPrice;
            timestamp = onchainTime;
        }
```

 However, `_getOnchainPrice` doesn't check [Sequencer Uptime Feed](https://basescan.org/address/0xBCF85224fc0756B9Fa45aA7892530B47e10b6433) to confirm the sequencer's status. So, if the Base Sequencer is down, the protocol could end up using stale data.

## Impact
This can lead to:
- Some leverage traders receiving a more favorable price than others when announcing to open, adjust, or close a long position.
- Some leverage traders getting liquidated by the `canLiquidate` function, even if they should not be.

## Recommendation
check the Sequencer Uptime Feed before consuming any price returned by a Chainlink Price Feed. The Chainlink documentation contains an example for how to check the sequencer status: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds
