# Missing Sequencer Uptime Feed check can cause unfair liquidations

## Summary

When the Base sequencer is down and then comes back up, all Chainlink price updates will become available within a very short time.

This leaves long-party no time to react to the price changes which can lead to unfair liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink explains their Sequencer Uptime Feeds in [[docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds).

> To help your applications identify when the sequencer is unavailable, you can use a data feed that tracks the last known status of the sequencer at a given point in time. This helps you prevent mass liquidations by providing a grace period to allow customers to react to such an event.

This issue lies in `_getOnchainPrice()`, which do not use the sequencer uptime feed to check the status of the sequencer:

```solidity
File: flatcoin-v1\src\OracleModule.sol
141:     function _getOnchainPrice() internal view returns (uint256 price, uint256 timestamp) {
142:         IChainlinkAggregatorV3 oracle = onchainOracle.oracleContract;
143:         if (address(oracle) == address(0)) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroAddress("oracle");
144:         
145:         (, int256 _price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
146:         timestamp = updatedAt;
147:         // check Chainlink oracle price updated within `maxAge` time.
148:         if (block.timestamp > timestamp + onchainOracle.maxAge)
149:             revert FlatcoinErrors.PriceStale(FlatcoinErrors.PriceSource.OnChain);
150: 
151:         if (_price > 0) {
152:             price = uint256(_price) * (10 ** 10); // convert Chainlink oracle decimals 8 -> 18
153:         } else {
154:             // Issue with onchain oracle indicates a serious problem
155:             revert FlatcoinErrors.PriceInvalid(FlatcoinErrors.PriceSource.OnChain);
156:         }
157:     }
```

## Impact

Users can get unfairly liquidated because they cannot react to price movements when the sequencer is down and when the sequencer comes back up, all price updates will immediately become available.

## Recommendation

The Chainlink documentation contains [[an example](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code) for how to check the sequencer status and shows [[available network](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#available-networks)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#available-networks) including Base.

There can be a grace period when the sequencer comes back up for users to act on their collateral (increase collateral to avoid liquidation).
