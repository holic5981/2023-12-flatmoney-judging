# Wrong order expired timestamp calculation

## Summary
Wrong order expired timestamp calculation

## Vulnerability Detail
In FlatcoinVault's description, **maxExecutabilityAge** means maximum amount of time that can expire between trade announcement and execution.

- Alice announces one order in timestampA. The expected expired timestamp should be **timestampA + maxExecutabilityAge**
- **executableAtTime** is marked at **timestampA + minExecutabilityAge**
- In Function hasOrderExpired(), we calculate **executableAtTime + maxExecutabilityAge** as the expired timestamp, which is larger than expected expired timestamp.

## Impact
Unexpected order expired check compared with origin design.
