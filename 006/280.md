# In the FlatcoinVault.setExecutabilityAge add an extra check

## Summary
 In FlatcoinVault.setExecutabilityAge add extra check to ensure that `_maxExecutabilityAge` is greater than `_maxExecutabilityAge` 

## Vulnerability Detail
 /// @notice The minimum time that needs to expire between trade announcement and execution.
    uint64 public minExecutabilityAge;

    /// @notice The maximum amount of time that can expire between trade announcement and execution.
    uint64 public maxExecutabilityAge;

both parameters check time expiration from trade announcement time. mix up of this value will lead to execuitablilty period being 0 thus  affecting trade execution

## Impact
DoS as a lack of execuitability period will hinder trade execution

## Recommendation
