# Missing check in `FlatcoinVault::setExecutabilityAge()` makes the time between executableAtTime and the maxExecutabilityAge short, resulting in more expired orders

## Summary
There is a missing check in [`FlatcoinVault::setExecutabilityAge()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/FlatcoinVault.sol#L417C1-L423C6) which makes it difficult for an order to be executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setExecutabilityAge()` is used to set the minimum and maximum order executability age. There is a check which ensures that none of the value provided is 0 but there isnt a check that prevents the minimum from being higher than the maximum. This missing check makes it possible to set the minimum and maximum to 60 seconds and 5 seconds respectively, for example.

## Impact
Using the values above, this means that order can only be executed in a 5 seconds window, 60 seconds from when the order was announced. With a short order execution window, there'll be more expired orders than executed ones.

## Code Snippet
`FlatcoinVault::setExecutabilityAge()`
```solidity
    function setExecutabilityAge(uint64 _minExecutabilityAge, uint64 _maxExecutabilityAge) public onlyOwner {
        if (_minExecutabilityAge == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("minExecutabilityAge");
        if (_maxExecutabilityAge == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("maxExecutabilityAge");

        minExecutabilityAge = _minExecutabilityAge;
        maxExecutabilityAge = _maxExecutabilityAge;
    }
```

`DelayedOrder::_prepareAnnouncementOrder()`
```solidity
    function _prepareAnnouncementOrder(uint256 keeperFee) internal returns (uint64 executableAtTime) {
        vault.settleFundingFees();

        if (keeperFee < IKeeperFee(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._KEEPER_FEE_MODULE_KEY)).getKeeperFee())
            revert FlatcoinErrors.InvalidFee(keeperFee);

        cancelExistingOrder(msg.sender);

        executableAtTime = uint64(block.timestamp + vault.minExecutabilityAge());
    }
```

`DelayedOrder::_prepareExecutionOrder()`
```solidity
    
    function _prepareExecutionOrder(address account, uint256 executableAtTime) internal {
        if (block.timestamp > executableAtTime + vault.maxExecutabilityAge()) revert FlatcoinErrors.OrderHasExpired();

        if (block.timestamp < executableAtTime) revert FlatcoinErrors.ExecutableTimeNotReached(executableAtTime);

        delete _announcedOrder[account];
    }
```

        if (_maxExecutabilityAge == 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroValue("maxExecutabilityAge");
+       if (_minExecutabilityAge >= _maxExecutabilityAge) revert;

        minExecutabilityAge = _minExecutabilityAge;
        maxExecutabilityAge = _maxExecutabilityAge;
    }
