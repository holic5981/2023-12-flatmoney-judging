# Not checking Negative Values

The problematic code in the `executeAdjust` function is related to the calculation of the new margin and size of the position without checking for negative values. Here is the problematic part of the code:

```solidity
uint256 newMargin = (marginAdjustment + PerpMath
    ._getPositionSummary({
        position: position,
        nextFundingEntry: cumulativeFunding,
        price: adjustPrice
    })
    .marginAfterSettlement).toUint256();

uint256 newAdditionalSize = (int256(position.additionalSize) + announcedAdjust.additionalSizeAdjustment)
    .toUint256();
```

In the above code, `marginAdjustment` and `announcedAdjust.additionalSizeAdjustment` are cast to `uint256` without checking if the resulting values are negative, which could lead to underflows and thus incorrect, extremely large values due to the way Solidity handles unsigned integers.

### Mitigation Code

To mitigate this issue, checks should be added to ensure that the resulting values for `newMargin` and `newAdditionalSize` are not negative before casting them to `uint256`. Here is the mitigation code:

```solidity
int256 newMarginInt = marginAdjustment + PerpMath
    ._getPositionSummary({
        position: position,
        nextFundingEntry: cumulativeFunding,
        price: adjustPrice
    })
    .marginAfterSettlement;

int256 newAdditionalSizeInt = int256(position.additionalSize) + announcedAdjust.additionalSizeAdjustment;

if (newMarginInt < 0 || newAdditionalSizeInt < 0) {
    revert("New margin or size adjustment results in negative value");
}

uint256 newMargin = uint256(newMarginInt);
uint256 newAdditionalSize = uint256(newAdditionalSizeInt);
```

### Impact 

- Negative adjustments would result in underflows when cast to `uint256`, leading to very large unintended values for `newMargin` and `newAdditionalSize`.
- Incorrectly large position sizes could put the user at risk of liquidation due to what would appear to be excessive leverage.
