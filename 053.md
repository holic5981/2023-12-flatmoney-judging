# StableModule::executeDeposit() can face Denial of Services preventing deposits temporarily and at unpredictable instances of time

## Summary
executeDeposit() function could revert due to division by zero error. While the possibility exists, the circumstances for its occurrence are erratic and random. The problem will occur **when totalAfterSettlement results in a value less than 0**.  This will result in  stableCollateralPerShare() being returned as 0 resulting in error during executeDeposit() call.

While the problematic circumstances remains, the executeDeposit() will revert for the calls.

## Vulnerability Detail
To understand the problems, below is the path of control flow for the function.

**a) StableModule::executeDeposit()**
    The executeDeposit() function computes _liquidityMinted by reading the collateral per share as below. The problem occurs if stableCollateralPerShare(maxAge) was returned as 0.
  
```solidity
    _liquidityMinted = (depositAmount * (10 ** decimals())) / stableCollateralPerShare(maxAge);
```
**b)  StableModule::stableCollateralPerShare()**   
    The stableCollateralPerShare() reads the stableBalance to compute **_collateralPerShare**, which can be zero under the 
    circumstances described in **item c)**. When zero, the _collateralPerShare will also become zero which is used in executeDeposit as  above.
```solidity
   uint256 stableBalance = stableCollateralTotalAfterSettlement(_maxAge);
    _collateralPerShare = (stableBalance * (10 ** decimals())) / totalSupply;
```
c) **StableModule::stableCollateralTotalAfterSettlement()**
    Stable collateral balance **will be 0 if vault's total stable collateral is less then netTotal** in leverage module as below.
    In such case **_stableCollateralBalance** will be returned as 0.
```solidity
       int256 netTotal = ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY))
            .fundingAdjustedLongPnLTotal({maxAge: _maxAge});
       int256 totalAfterSettlement = int256(vault.stableCollateralTotal()) - netTotal;

       if (totalAfterSettlement < 0) {
           _stableCollateralBalance = 0;
```

As a result of this flow, in the executeDeposit(), the stableCollateralPerShare will return as 0 resulting in throwing the exception.

## Impact
Denial of service due to division by zero error.

## Code Snippet
in the executeDeposit() function, refer to line 70 where _liquidityMinted is computed. If stableCollateralPerShare() returns 0,
then the problem will occur.

In stableCollateralPerShare() function, if stableBalance is 0, _collateralPerShare will also result in 0. Refer to line 211 to 214 in the below code reference.

stableCollateralTotalAfterSettlement() function, refer to lines from 190  to 193, when totalAfterSettlement is less than 0, _stableCollateralBalance will also become 0. This number contributes to stableCollateralPerShare() resulting on division by zero error.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check at the time of deposit for total balance of collateral and leveraged positions. If the circumstances prevent minting of more Unit tokens, notify that elegantly to the user.
