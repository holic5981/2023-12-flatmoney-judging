# Unhandled Chainlink price feed revert

## Summary

Chainlink price feed reverts are not handled.

## Vulnerability Detail

The execution of `OracleModule.sol:getPrice()` will revert if the Chainlink price feed is not available or the return data does not pass the validation. 

During certain exceptional circumstances, Chainlink oracles may become inaccessible. While the event of an offchain oracle price being invalid is handled, the onchain oracle price is not.

## Impact

All operations that rely on the price feed will revert, including liquidations and PnL calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of directly invoking the `latestRoundData()` function, enclose it within a try-catch block. In the event that the call encounters a revert, mark the onchain price as invalid.
