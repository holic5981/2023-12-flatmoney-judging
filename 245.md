# `getKeeperFee` uses 2 oracles with the same _STALENESS_PERIOD, when their heartbeats could be different.

## Summary
`getKeeperFee` uses 2 oracles with the same _STALENESS_PERIOD, when their heartbeats could be different.

## Vulnerability Detail
`getKeeprFee` uses `ethOracle`:

```solidity
        {
            (, int256 ethPrice, , uint256 ethPriceupdatedAt, ) = _ethOracle.latestRoundData();
            if (block.timestamp >= ethPriceupdatedAt + _STALENESS_PERIOD) revert FlatcoinErrors.ETHPriceStale();
            if (ethPrice <= 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ETHPriceInvalid();
            ethPrice18 = uint256(ethPrice) * 1e10; // from 8 decimals to 18
        }
```
and it also uses `_oracleModule`:

```solidity
        // NOTE: Currently the market asset and collateral asset are the same.
        // If this changes in the future, then the following line should fetch the collateral asset, not market asset.
        (uint256 collateralPrice, uint256 timestamp) = _oracleModule.getPrice();
```      

Note the comment in the above code block. If the market asset and collateral asset are the same, then the same staleness period can be used. However, there is a possibility that it can be changed in the future and the market asset and collateral asset can differ. So, the same `_STALENESS_PERIOD` or heartbeat should not be used. 

## Impact
Stale prices might be used because of using the same heartbeat for 2 different oracles.
