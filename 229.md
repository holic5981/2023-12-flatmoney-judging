# Division by Zero:

## Summary
Division by Zero: The code should ensure that division by zero cannot occur. For example, in _calcLiquidationPrice, if position.additionalSize is zero, it could lead to a division by zero error.

## Vulnerability Detail
function _calcLiquidationPrice(
        FlatcoinStructs.Position memory position,
        FlatcoinStructs.PositionSummary memory positionSummary,
        uint256 liquidationMargin
    ) private pure returns (int256 liqPrice) {
        // A position can be liquidated whenever:- remainingMargin <= liquidationMargin
        //
        // Hence, expanding the definition of remainingMargin the exact price at which a position can be liquidated is:
        //
        // liquidationMargin = margin + profitLoss + funding
        // liquidationMargin = margin + [(price - entryPrice) * postionSize / price] + funding
        // liquidationMargin - (margin + funding) = [(price - entryPrice) * postionSize / price]
        // liquidationMargin - (margin + funding) = postionSize - (entryPrice * postionSize / price)
        // positionSize - [liquidationMargin - (margin + funding)] = entryPrice * postionSize / price
        // positionSize * entryPrice / {positionSize - [liquidationMargin - (margin + funding)]} = price
        //
        // In our case, positionSize = position.additionalSize.
        // Note: If there are bounds on `liquidationFee` and/or `keeperFee` then this formula doesn't yield an accurate liquidation price.
        // This is because, when the position size is too large such that liquidation fee for that position has to be bounded we are essentially
        // solving the following equation:
        // LiquidationBuffer + (LiquidationUpperBound / Price) + KeeperFee = Margin + (Price - EntryPrice)*PositionSize + AccruedFunding
        // And according to Wolfram Alpha, this equation cannot be solved for Price (at least trivially):
        // https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=A+++(B+/+X)+%3D+C+++(X+-+D)+*+E+,+X+%3E+0,+Solution+for+variable+X
        return
       @>     int256((position.additionalSize)._multiplyDecimal(position.lastPrice))._divideDecimal(
                int256(position.additionalSize + position.marginDeposited) +
                    positionSummary.accruedFunding -
                    int256(liquidationMargin)
            );
    }

## Recommendation
use a require statement  for zero check.
