# liquidation function cannot be closed if  protocol is paused

## Summary
When the protocol is paused, liquidation function is set to revert when called . This causes closing and liquidating of loans to be impossible before `order.executableAtTime`  is reached, leading to two issues. The first is that users with existing loans are unable to close their loans to recover their collateral. The second is that the protocol could end up being stuck with a lot of bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
This Function can only be called when the protocol is not not paused.
```solidity
 function liquidate(uint256 tokenId) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused liquidationInvariantChecks(vault, tokenId) {}
```

## Impact
Outstanding loans cannot be closed or liquidated, freezing user funds and causing the protocol to take on bad debt
