# Approved Operator can not call several functions

## Summary
NFT position operator who is approved by NFT owner can not adjust position or close the position. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions like `announceLeverageAdjust()` and `announceLeverageClose()` of DelayedOrder contract and `announceLimitOrder()` of LimitOrder have validation checks that owner of `tokenId` is `msg.sender` or not. Since a position NFT is tradable/transferrable (as confirmed by developer), if NFT owner approves another user to operate their NFT by calling `approve()` or `setApprovalForAll()` and approved operator call mentioned functions it will always revert.
```solidity
if (leverageModule.ownerOf(tokenId) != msg.sender) revert FlatcoinErrors.NotTokenOwner(tokenId, msg.sender);
```
**Proof of Concept:**
1. Assume a scenario where a position NFT owner approves another user as an operator for their positions using the `approve()`.
2. The approved operator attempts to call the announceLeverageAdjust() function to adjust the leverage, but the function reverts as it does not recognize the operator's approval.
## Impact
This issue limits the functionality of the announceLeverageAdjust(), announceLeverageClose() and announceLimitOrder() as it fails to recognize the approval status of operators. Due to this users have to suffer lose as position can't be adjusted/closed at desired time.

## Recommendation
Allow operators of token's owner to call functions on behalf of owner.
