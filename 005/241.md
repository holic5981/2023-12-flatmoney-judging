# There is no oracle for reth/usd on base and the protocol does not account for it.

## Summary
There is no oracle for reth/usd and the protocol does not account for it.

## Vulnerability Detail
The reth oracle on base is for the pair reth/eth - https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1&search=reth. So, the contract needs to be updated to use reth/eth and eth/usd oracles to get the price of reth/usd. While doing so, care must also be taken to use 2 different heartbeats associated with each oracle to check for staleness.

## Impact
The wrong price of the asset will be used by the protocol
