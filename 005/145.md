# `OracleModule` is broken because there is no `RETH/USD` Chainlink oracle on Base chain

## Summary

Current `OracleModule` cannot behave normally on Base, because it relies on a oracle which follows interface `IChainlinkAggregatorV3` and returns RETH/USD price feed.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to Chainlink,

There is only a RETH/ETH feed on Base, so `OracleModule` is bricked.

And, it is worth noting that even if `RETH/ETH` + `ETH/USD` is used, there would be more issue: `RETH/ETH` has a 24h heartbeat and `ETH/USD` has a 20min heartbeat, so the price would always be stale feed multiply fresh feed.

## Impact

`OracleModule` cannot return correct price feed.
