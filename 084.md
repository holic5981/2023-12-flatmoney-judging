# Users can continually update their orders to get a free look into prices in future blocks

## Summary
Users can continually update their orders to get a free look into prices in future blocks

## Vulnerability Detail
Order execution relies on signed archived prices from off-chain oracles, where each price is stored along with the block range it applies to, and limit orders are only allowed to execute with oracle prices where the block is greater than the block in which the order was last updated. Since prices are required to be future prices, there is a time gap between when the last signed price was archived, and the new price for the next block is stored in the archive, and the order keeper is able to fetch it and submit an execution for it in the next block.

## Impact
If a user has a pending exit order that was submitted a block N, and the user sees that the price at block N+1 will be more favorable, they can update their exit order, changing the amount by +/- 1 wei, and have the order execution delayed until the next block, at which point they can decided again whether the price and or impact is favorable, and whether to exit.
