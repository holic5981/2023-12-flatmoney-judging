# Missing skew check in announceLeverageAdjust

## Summary
Missing skew check in announceLeverageAdjust

## Vulnerability Detail
In current announceLeverageAdjust() implementation, when additionalSizeAdjustment is positive, we think it's possible to increase skew. So we need to add checkSkewMax(). We do not add checkSkewMax() check when additionalSizeAdjustment is negative.

However, it's possible to increase skew when additionalSizeAdjustment is negative.
For example, if parameters 'marginAdjustment' and 'additionalSizeAdjustment' are both negative, it's possible to increase skew.

## Impact
Missing checkSkewMax check. System's skew can exceed max skew.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checkSkewMax() check even if additionalSizeAdjustment is negative.
