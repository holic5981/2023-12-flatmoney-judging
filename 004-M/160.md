# There is no Chainlink rETH/USD data feed on Base Mainnet

## Summary
The protocol has specified that they are going to deploy on the BASE network, and they are going to use rETH as a collateral token. In order for the protocol to work it needs to know the price of rETH in USD, but there is no such data feed on [Base](https://data.chain.link/feeds) as of writing this report 04/02/2024. There is a [rETH/ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/base/base/reth-eth) data feed but the protocol is not configured to convert rETH/ETH price to USD.  This makes the whole protocol obsolete. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When the [``_getOnchainPrice()``](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/OracleModule.sol#L141-L157) gets called the call will revert as there is no such data feed, or if other data feed is used the price will be wrong. It won't matter that there is a Pyth oracle integrated as well. 
## Impact
The whole protocol won't work.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the ``OracleModule.sol`` so it can convert chainlink rETH/ETH prices to USD utilizing ETH/USD data feed.
