# The initialization contract `FlatcoinVault` fails if `_owner` is not the `msg.sender`

## Summary

The following methods are called during the initialization process: `setMaxFundingVelocity`, `setMaxVelocitySkew`, `setStableCollateralCap`, `setSkewFractionMax`, `setExecutabilityAge`.
These operations can be reverted if executed by someone other than the owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability resides in the `FlatcoinVault.initialize(...)` function: [source] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/bba4f077a64f43fbd565f8983388d0e985cb85db/flatcoin-v1/src/FlatcoinVault.sol#L109C1-L131C6) 

The function `__Ownable_init()` sets `msg.sender` as the owner of the `FlatcoinVault` contract. Subsequently, the function `_transferOwnership(_owner)` changes the contract's ownership to `_owner`, which is an argument of the``initialize(...)` function.

Functions `setMaxFundingVelocity`, `setMaxVelocitySkew`, `setStableCollateralCap`, `setSkewFractionMax`, `setExecutabilityAge` have a modifier `onlyOwner`. However, `msg.sender` for these functions is `msg.sender` of `initialize(...)` function, not the owner set in the function `_transferOwnership(_owner)`.

Therefore, if the  `owner` set in `_transferOwnership(_owner)` is not the same as `msg.sender` of `initialize(...)` function, the function will fail.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability on smart contract operation is very large. If initialization fails, the contract will not work as intended. To solve this problem, the contract needs to be re-deployed.

## Code Snippet

If the argument `_owner: admin` is changed to `_owner: carol` in `Setup.sol` and the function `vaultProxy.initialize(...)` is called, the operation will fail.

```diff

        vaultProxy.initialize({
-           _owner: admin,
+           _owner: carol,
            ...
        });

```

result:

```javascript

Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/unit/Flatcoin-Vault/FlatcoinVault.t.sol:FlatcoinVaultTest
[FAIL. Reason: setup failed: revert: Ownable: caller is not the owner] setUp() (gas: 0)

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue, call `_transferOwnership(_owner)` at the end of the `FlatcoinVault.initialize(...)` function.

```diff
    function initialize(
        address _owner,
        IERC20Upgradeable _collateral,
        uint256 _maxFundingVelocity,
        uint256 _maxVelocitySkew,
        uint256 _skewFractionMax,
        uint256 _stableCollateralCap,
        uint64 _minExecutabilityAge,
        uint64 _maxExecutabilityAge
    ) external initializer {
        if (address(_collateral) == address(0)) revert FlatcoinErrors.ZeroAddress("collateral");

        __Ownable_init();
-       _transferOwnership(_owner);

        collateral = _collateral;

        setMaxFundingVelocity(_maxFundingVelocity);
        setMaxVelocitySkew(_maxVelocitySkew);
        setStableCollateralCap(_stableCollateralCap);
        setSkewFractionMax(_skewFractionMax);
        setExecutabilityAge(_minExecutabilityAge, _maxExecutabilityAge);

+        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }

```
