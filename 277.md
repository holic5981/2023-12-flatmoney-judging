# Time Manipulation Vulnerability in FlatcoinVault Contract

## Summary
The `FlatcoinVault` contract relies on `block.timestamp` for critical functionality related to funding rate calculations. This introduces a vulnerability to miner timestamp manipulation that could allow attackers to exploit the contract for profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the use of `block.timestamp` in functions like:

```
lastRecomputedFundingTimestamp = (block.timestamp).toUint64();
```

And reliance on it for funding rate calculations:

``` 
int256 fundingChangeSinceRecomputed = PerpMath._fundingChangeSinceRecomputed({
  proportionalSkew: proportionalSkew,
  prevFundingModTimestamp: lastRecomputedFundingTimestamp,
  // ...
});
```

## Impact
Manipulate funding rate calculations to their advantage

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use block number instead of timestamp for interval measurements
