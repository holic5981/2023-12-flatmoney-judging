# collateralPerShare can maniuplated to become very expensive  even lead to a dos attack.

## Summary
The collateral per share is determined by the total supply of the stableModule token, Every user is forces to use a common `collateralpershare` irrespective of the amount deposited. 

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker may exploit the system by depositing a large amount of reth to generate a significant quantity of stableModule tokens, thereby inflating the total supply. This manipulation leads to a rise in the collateral per share.

For instance, if an attacker deposits 1 stable token as collateral for $1,000, causing a surge in the total supply, User A may find it impossible to utilize 1 stable token as collateral for the same $1,000. Consequently, User B would have to pay more for the identical $1,000 deposit. Over time, the collateral per share becomes prohibitively expensive.

## Impact
This manipulation forces an increase in the collateral per share for other users, potentially culminating in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

## Recommendation
1.collateral per share can be a fixed amount that is regulated by the admin from time to time.
