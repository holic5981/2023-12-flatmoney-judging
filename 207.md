# User can not cancel immediately

## Summary
User can not cancel immediately
## Vulnerability Detail
Below condition in the `cancelExistingOrder()` does not let user the cancel order before 4 minutes approx (As discussed with developer they are intended to set `maxExecutabilityAge` to 2 minutes and `minExecutabilityAge` is not fixed yet so let's suppose this is also 2 minutes.).
```solidty
if (block.timestamp <= order.executableAtTime + vault.maxExecutabilityAge())
```
where 
```solidity
executableAtTime = uint64(block.timestamp + vault.minExecutabilityAge());
```

This checks prevents traders from canceling their orders immediately after the announce the order. As crypto is volatile market anything can happen in 4 minutes. Additionally trader have to pay trade fee and keeper fee when opening and closing the position both the times although they decided to cancel the order.

**Proof of Concept**
1. Trader open position by calling `announceLeverageOpen()`.
2. Price starts rising up from the current price in a few seconds.
3. Order has not executed yet.
4. Trader cancel the order by calling `cancelExistingOrder()`. But due to above mentioned checks they have to wait for few minutes.
5. Keeper executes the order.

## Impact
The inability to cancel orders when user wants can have severe consequence for traders, especially in scenarios sudden pump.
