# Malicious users gas grief keepers with limit orders

## Summary
The protocol allows users to create limit orders that can be executed when a price reaches a threshold set by the user but the same time restraint set in [DelayedOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L421-L422) is not set for limit orders.

## Vulnerability Detail
A problem arises since the owner of the limit order, can cancel the order at any point since the limit orders do not adhear to the same time restraint that market orders do, consider the following case:

UserA creates a limit order
The price goes within the position range
UserB then wants the execute the userAs order 
UserA front runs userBs TX and cancels the order
Leaving UserB with a failed TX and a loss of the gas expenditure

## Impact

## Code Snippet
```Solidity
    function cancelLimitOrder(uint256 tokenId) external {
        address positionOwner = _checkPositionOwner(tokenId);
        _checkLimitCloseOrder(tokenId);

        delete _limitOrderClose[tokenId];// Delete the limit order

        ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).unlock(tokenId);

        emit FlatcoinEvents.OrderCancelled({account: positionOwner, orderType: FlatcoinStructs.OrderType.LimitClose});
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce the same time restraint that is on announced orders to not allow for this to be done within a short time frame.
