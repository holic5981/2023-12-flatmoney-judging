# Malicious users can obtain large amounts of FMP at a small cost

## Summary

FMP is distributed to both long and short parties as an incentive.  
1. The long party can obtain FMP via [[announceLeverageOpen](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L160-L165)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L160-L165)/[[announceLeverageAdjust](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L217-L223)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L217-L223), and the amount depends on the additionalSize of the position.  
2. The short side (stable LP) can obtain FMP via [[announceStableDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L67-L71)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L67-L71), and the amount depends on the amount of deposited collateral.

Malicious users can obtain large amounts of FMP by repeatedly opening and closing position.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a DelayedOrder is created, it will be written to `_announcedOrder[msg.sender]`. It is defined as `mapping(address account => FlatcoinStructs.Order order)`. An `Order` structure is defined as follows:

```solidity
File: flatcoin-v1\src\libraries\FlatcoinStructs.sol
60:     struct Order {
61:         OrderType orderType;
62:         uint256 keeperFee; // The deposit paid upon submitting that needs to be paid / refunded on tx confirmation
63:->       uint64 executableAtTime; // The timestamp at which this order is executable at
64:         bytes orderData;
65:     }
```

`Order.executableAtTime` is set to `block.timestamp + minExecutabilityAge(5s)`. This means that when a pending order is created, it must wait at least 5 seconds before being executed. Pending orders will expire, and the order execution time cannot be greater than `Order.executableAtTime + maxExecutabilityAge (60s)`. [[_prepareExecutionOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L650-L658)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/src/DelayedOrder.sol#L650-L658) is used to check whether `Order.executableAtTime` meets the conditions.

When the price of the collateral is stable and does not fluctuate violently. Malicious users may need to spend a small fee to obtain FMP. In good cases, it can even be profitable. Letâ€™s give an example to illustrate.

Bob wrote a robot to automatically open and close positions. A process is as follows:

1.  Call `announceLeverageOpen` to create a pending LeverageOpen order. The `margin` is 1e18 collateral and the `additionalSize` is 3e18.
2.  After `minExecutabilityAge` seconds have passed, the robot, as the keeper, calls `DelayedOrder.executeOrder` to execute the pending order created in step 1. Therefore, the position is opened, and the number of FMP that bob gets is: `additionalSize * pointsPerSize / 1e18`. Through the test from [[test setup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/test/helpers/Setup.sol#L201)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney/blob/main/flatcoin-v1/test/helpers/Setup.sol#L201), we know that `pointsPerSize = 100e18`. Then, the amount of FMP obtained in this case is: `3e18 * 100e18 / 1e18 = 300e18`.
3.  Call `announceLeverageClose` to create a pending LeverageClose order.
4.  After `minExecutabilityAge` seconds have passed, the robot calls `DelayedOrder.executeOrder` to execute the pending order created in step 3. Therefore, the position is closed.

The life cycle of a position may be `minExecutabilityAge(5)` seconds. **In the Base chain, a block is mined in an average of 2 seconds**, which means that the life cycle of a position may be 3-4 blocks. The `fundFee` generated during this time period is basically negligible. If the price of collateral stabilizes, malicious users can take advantage of this issue to obtain large amounts of FMP at a small cost. If the closing price is greater than the opening price, the position can be profitable.

Therefore, it is possible to automate the above process to obtain large quantities of FMP.

## Impact

FMP serves as an incentive for users as a protocol. We can think of it as a reward token. Malicious users can obtain large amounts of FMP at a small cost.
