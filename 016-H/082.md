# PerpMath._profitLoss() caluclates the profit/loss wrongly.

## Summary
 PerpMath._profitLoss() caluclates the profit/loss wrongly. The main problem is that is uses ``price`` instead of ``lastPrice`` as the denominator. As a result, profit is calculated larger than expected and loss is calculated smaller than exepcted. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. The  PerpMath._profitLoss() calculates the profit and loss based on the new price and the lastPrice. However, it uses ``price`` instead of ``lastPrice`` as the denominator. As a result, profit is calculated larger than expected and loss is calculated smaller than exepcted.

2. For example, suppose lastPrice = 100, additionalSize = 1000, and new price = 120, so priceShift = 20. the profit should be 20*1000/100 = 200. However, using the implementation, the calculated profit is only 165. On the otherhand, when the price decreases, the donominator will use the new price which is smaller than it is supposed to be. As a result, the loss will be enlarged by mistake. 

The following POC shows my finding:

contract PerpMath {
    uint256  public lastPrice = 100;
    uint256 additionalSize = 1000;

    // new price = 120, so I should gain 1000*20/100 = 200

    function _profitLoss(uint256 price) public view returns (int256 pnl) {
        int256 priceShift = int256(price) - int256(lastPrice);
        int256 profitLossTimesTen = int256(additionalSize) * (priceShift) * 10 / int256(price);

        if (profitLossTimesTen % 10 != 0) {
            return profitLossTimesTen / 10 - 1;
        } else {
            return profitLossTimesTen / 10;
        }
    }

}

contract FundingTest is Test {
    PerpMath p;
   
    function setUp() public {
        p = new PerpMath();
    }
   
    function testPnl() public{
        int256 pnl = p._profitLoss(120);

        console2.log("pnl: %", pnl);
    }
}
```
