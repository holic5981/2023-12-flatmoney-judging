# rETH collateral address should not be hardcoded as the rETH protocol could be upgraded

## Summary

rETH collateral address should not be hardcoded as the rETH protocol could be upgraded

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol expects to use rETH as collateral shown here 

```solidity
  vault.collateral().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), margin + keeperFee + tradeFee);
```

The issue is that the address is not properly fetched. RocketPool suggests to retrieve the rETH address from rocketpool storage (which will never change) instead of setting the address manually. The reason for this is that the protocol could upgrade and change the rETH address causing unexpected behavior in the protocol. The recommended method allows the protocol to get the address in real time.

## Impact
Protocol may not work properly and collateral may be lost due to an incorrect rETH token address

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Address should be fetched in real time instead of hardcoding it by referencing Rocketpool storage since that address will never change
