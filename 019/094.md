# Non refundable Fees sent to pay the Pyth off-chain oracle will be locked in the contract

## Summary
`updatePythPrice` function takes a fee when users update the price data, the fees is sent along with the call as `msg.value` and the fees is deducted from it, if there's any left over `value` after the call it is refunded back to the user.
The issue is when the user have a fallback function to reject all incoming Eth the user won't be able to receive the refund and there's no way to retrieve such failed transaction Eth from the `oracleModule` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function updatePythPrice(address sender, bytes[] calldata priceUpdateData) external payable nonReentrant {
        // Get fee amount to pay to Pyth
        uint256 fee = offchainOracle.oracleContract.getUpdateFee(priceUpdateData);

        // Update the price data (and pay the fee)
        offchainOracle.oracleContract.updatePriceFeeds{value: fee}(priceUpdateData);

        if (msg.value - fee > 0) {
            // Need to refund caller. Try to return unused value, or revert if failed
            (bool success, ) = sender.call{value: msg.value - fee}("");
            if (success == false) revert FlatcoinErrors.RefundFailed();
```
The function is marked payable indicating the function can receive ETH, the fees is then calculated in the `getUpdateFee` function which returns the amount of fee the user will pay for the update.

If the user sent more  Eth than  required for the fee the rest is sent back to the sender 
```solidity
    if (msg.value - fee > 0) {
            // Need to refund caller. Try to return unused value, or revert if failed
            (bool success, ) = sender.call{value: msg.value - fee}("");
            if (success == false) revert FlatcoinErrors.RefundFailed();
```
Which reverts on failure if the refund fails.

## Impact
Non refundable Eth will remain locked on the contract
