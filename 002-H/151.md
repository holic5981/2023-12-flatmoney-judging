# Users could gain a lot of points by wash trading.

## Summary
Users could gain a lot of points by wash trading.
## Vulnerability Detail
Every time the `executeDeposit` function is executed user is minted points based on the `depositAmount`. Users could do wash trading by depositing and withdrawing multiple times to gain a lot of points. The only fee the user needs to pay is the `gasFee` for announcing, the `keeperFee` for execution, and any possible slippage. The same thing can be done while opening or adjusting a new leveraged position.

```solidity
function executeDeposit(
    address _account,
    uint64 _executableAtTime,
    FlatcoinStructs.AnnouncedStableDeposit calldata _announcedDeposit
) external whenNotPaused onlyAuthorizedModule returns (uint256 _liquidityMinted) {
    ...
    IPointsModule pointsModule = IPointsModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._POINTS_MODULE_KEY));
    pointsModule.mintDeposit(_account, _announcedDeposit.depositAmount);
    ...
}
```
## Impact
This makes the concept of points pointless as anyone could get a large number of points with minimal risk and effort.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the points should represent something valuable there should be a different way of distributing the points. Maybe based on the duration of the stable collateral deposit. The longer the user has an open position the more points are accrued. This also provides greater value to the protocol as collateral stays in the contract for a longer period of time instead of just a few blocks for wash trading.
