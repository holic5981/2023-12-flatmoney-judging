# Users can pay a small fee with a token to mint a large amount of points

## Summary
Every time a deposit or open position is executed, the protocol mints points for the user. Users can continuously deposit, withdraw, and mint large amounts of points.

## Vulnerability Detail
Every time the `StableModule.executeDeposit()` function is called, the protocol invokes `pointsModule.mintDeposit()` to mint points for the user.
```solidity
        // Mint points
        IPointsModule pointsModule = IPointsModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._POINTS_MODULE_KEY));
        pointsModule.mintDeposit(_account, _announcedDeposit.depositAmount);

```

 However, no action is taken in `StableModule.executeWithdraw()`. The issue arises from the fact that users can repeatedly call `DelayedOrder.announceStableDeposit()`, followed by `DelayedOrder.announceStableWithdraw()`, allowing them to obtain a large number of points with minimal fees. The same issue exists in the LeverageModule as well.

## Impact
Users can obtain a large number of points by paying minimal fees with the smallest assets.
