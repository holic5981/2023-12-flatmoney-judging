# getKeeperFee is calculating the keeper fee based on the ETH price not rETH

## Summary
There mentioned in the README that the collateral will be rETH but getKeeperFee is actually calculating keeper-fee based on the ETH price not rETH.
## Vulnerability Detail
Wee the function is calculating the fee based on the ETH price, but it actually should be the rETH:
```solidity
function getKeeperFee() public view returns (uint256 keeperFeeCollateral) {
        uint256 ethPrice18;
        {
            (, int256 ethPrice, , uint256 ethPriceupdatedAt, ) = _ethOracle.latestRoundData();
            if (block.timestamp >= ethPriceupdatedAt + _STALENESS_PERIOD) revert FlatcoinErrors.ETHPriceStale();
            if (ethPrice <= 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.ETHPriceInvalid();
            ethPrice18 = uint256(ethPrice) * 1e10; // from 8 decimals to 18
        }
        // NOTE: Currently the market asset and collateral asset are the same.
        // If this changes in the future, then the following line should fetch the collateral asset, not market asset.
        (uint256 collateralPrice, uint256 timestamp) = _oracleModule.getPrice();

        if (collateralPrice <= 0) revert FlatcoinErrors.PriceInvalid(FlatcoinErrors.PriceSource.OnChain);

        if (block.timestamp >= timestamp + _STALENESS_PERIOD)
            revert FlatcoinErrors.PriceStale(FlatcoinErrors.PriceSource.OnChain);
```
## Impact
Wrong collateralPrice will be calculated and wrong amount will be calculated for keeper-fee.
